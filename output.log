The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network.

As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer.

Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ).

Shortly thereafter,\\nself-supervised learning based on autoregressive language modeling (predict the next word given\\nthe previous words) [Dai and Le 2015] became popular. This produced models that represented\\nwords in context, such as GPT [Radford et al .2018], ELMo [Peters et al .2018], and ULMFiT [Howard\\nand Ruder 2018].4\\nThe next wave of developments in self-supervised learning \\u2014 BERT [Devlin et al .2019] GPT-2\\n[Radford et al .2019], RoBERTa [Liu et al .2019], T5 [Raffel et al .2019], BART [Lewis et al .2020a] \\u2014\\nquickly followed, embracing the Transformer architecture, incorporating more powerful deep\\nbidirectional encoders of sentences, and scaling up to larger models and datasets.\\nWhile one can view this last wave of technical developments purely through the lens of self-\\nsupervised learning, there was a sociological inflection point around the introduction of BERT.\\nBefore 2019, self-supervised learning with language models was essentially a subarea in NLP, which\\nprogressed in parallel to other developments in NLP.

Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting\\u2014Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20. (These particular exemplars did not undergo\\nprompt engineering; robustness is studied in Section 3.4 and Appendix A.2.) To investigate whether\\nchain-of-thought prompting in this form can successfully elicit successful reasoning across a range of\\n3\\n\\nlanguage models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are\\nprovided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.\\nFigure 1 shows an example of a model producing a chain of thought to solve a math word problem\\nthat it would have otherwise gotten incorrect.

We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting\\u2014Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20. (These particular exemplars did not undergo\\nprompt engineering; robustness is studied in Section 3.4 and Appendix A.2.)

A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine a redesign of a neuron"}], "model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.9}' message='Post details'

Algorithmic complexity: Length of the program to generate the state (given a language)\\nIn this research, we are instead interested in the circuit complexity of a state. Circuit complexity is related\\nto algorithmic complexity [29], which in turn is related to statistical [30] and computational complexities [31].\\nComputational complexities typically deal with asymptotic scaling behavior and provides lower bounds. Though\\nfamilies of circuits have speci\\ufb01c complexity class hierarchy (e.g., ACi,TCi,NCi) it is not of much interest for\\nthis research. We will focus on circuits with bounded size (in both space and time). Similarly, the expected\\nKolmogorov complexity has been shown to correspond to the Shannon entropy [30], though this relation is not\\nof immediate importance to this work. [29] Kolmogorov complexity can be shown being very similar to circuit\\ncomplexity under certain considerations [29]. Another similar relation is that truth tables of functions with\\nsmall circuit complexity has small Kolmogorov complexity. Counting arguments relating circuit, algorithmic\\nand statistical complexities has been suggested in [15, 16] in terms of Lagrangian action. Our research in\\nanother step in this rather niche \\ufb01eld of understanding observed states via di\\ufb00erent perspectives.\\nIt is important to note that most research on algorithmic information theory has been in the context of\\nuniversal automata, e.g. Turing machines, lambda calculus, cellular automata, etc. The size of the description\\ndepends on how expressive the symbols are for the transformations. What we described so far, i.e., transfor-\\nmations as a relation between two states, is typically the case in the language of circuits. Program written\\nin more abstract logical framework allow more powerful primitives, like universal and existential quanti\\ufb01ers in\\n\\ufb01rst-order or higher-order logic. Typically, an universal computation model demands a recursively enumerable\\nlanguage. In the Chomsky hierarchy, Turing machines are more powerful than linear-bounded automata, which\\nare inturn more powerful than push-down automata and in turn, \\ufb01nite-state machines (FSM). See [32] for a\\ncomparison of these for both classical and quantum computing models. However, for less powerful automata\\nand language models, it is possible to derive corresponding notions [33] of algorithmic complexity. This is\\nimportant as programs written in Turing-complete languages eventually gets translated via the layers of the\\ncomputing stack and gets executed by logic circuits. These logic circuits are however a combination of sequential\\n(allowing memory cells) and combinatorial logic, and can be used to simulate an FSM. Purely combinatorial\\nlogic (not to be confused with combinatory logic, which is universal) is of even lower power than FSM. The\\nformer is loopless and stateless, and thereby is a direct representation of the output state based on the input.\\nIt is important to note that, program execution is typically clocked in both classical and quantum processors\\nto prevent race-conditions, even if the circuits are purely composed of combinatorial logic elements. Thus,\\nresources of time and space can be de\\ufb01ned in this setting even without tracking and accessing intermediate\\nstates. By borrowing notions from algorithmic information theory (as de\\ufb01ned on functional programs), in this\\nwork, we study the e\\ufb00ect of circuit complexity of Boolean/quantum combinatorial logic on state complexity.\\n3 Landscape of circuits\\nWith this background of the measures of complexity, let us now \\ufb01rst explore the landscape of Boolean circuits.\\nThe quantum circuit model is inspired by and is a generalization of the Boolean circuit model, so, it would be\\nnatural to start with a classical model and generalize it to the corresponding quantum formulation.\\n4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine a redesign of a neuron"}], "model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.9}' message='Post details'

Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on. Whether a pattern is de-\\ntectable depends on the expressiveness of the function. With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term. Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication. From\\nthe perspective of a single neuron, this can be written as:\\n[\\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56]=\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\u210e(n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56\\u00b7[\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,1]\\ud835\\udc47).

The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs.

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself.

All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network.

Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems.

We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer.

Open-ended search in the\\nspace of quantum processes can greatly bene\\ufb01t from a characterization of this landscape, as presented in this\\nwork.\\n5.3 Quantum arti\\ufb01cial general intelligence\\nAmong the more rigorous methods of developing general intelligence is an active formulation of Solomono\\ufb00\\u2019s\\ntheory of inductive intelligence [34], called universal arti\\ufb01cial intelligence [18]. Universal reinforcement learning\\nmodels like AIXI and KSA are capable of rational decision-making or modelling environmental dynamics, based\\non the shortest program that corresponds to compressing the past observations and maximizing a set reward\\nfunction. These have been quantized both by using quantum algorithms, (e.g., in the AIXI-q model [64]) and\\nby applying them to quantum environments (e.g., in the QKSA model [65]).\\nAnother crucial aspect of intelligence [66] is the understanding of cause-e\\ufb00ect relations. Quantum acceler-\\nation of causal inference [67, 68, 69] can bene\\ufb01t from the knowledge of the probability distribution of causal\\noracles, a subset of quantum processes that embed speci\\ufb01c properties of the problem. Besides causal inference,\\nsimilar techniques can be applied to other statistical relational learning applications like probabilistic logic\\nnetworks [70] and quantum variational algorithms.\\nBoth universal distribution and causal inference are intimately connected to the landscape of quantum\\nprograms. This landscape inturn depends on the choice of a speci\\ufb01c gate set, as we saw in this research.\\nThereby, novelty seeking in the space of universal gate sets can meta-optimize quantum program synthesis\\nfor speci\\ufb01c application algorithms. In our current research, we are exploring this direction of second-order\\ncybernetics of automated quantum operational theory, by using the groundwork developed in this article.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis project was initiated under the QIntern 2021 project \\u201cReinforcement Learning Agent for Quantum\\nFoundations\\u201d.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer bene\\ufb01ts such as improved\\nperformance and sample ef\\ufb01ciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The \\u201cother category\\u201d included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of errors in all\\nthree categories. Examples of semantic understanding and one-step missing errors that were \\ufb01xed by\\nscaling PaLM to 540B are given in Figure 10. This result appears consistent with a hypothesis that\\nlanguage models acquire a range of semantic understanding and logical reasoning skills as a function\\nof model scale (though note that model scale is often con\\ufb02ated with other factors, such as amount of\\ntraining compute).\\nSemantic understanding\\n(62B made 20 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 6 of them)One step missing\\n(62B made 18 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 12 of them)Other\\n(62B made 7 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 4 of them)Types of errors made by a 62B language model:Errors \\ufb01xed by scaling from 62B to 540B\\nFigure 9: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. These errors were categorized\\nthat semantic understanding, one step missing, and other. The other category includes hallucinations,\\nrepetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. Scaling PaLM to 540B \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of\\nerrors in all categories.\\nThere are also three notable points regarding why small language models fail. The \\ufb01rst observation\\nis that small language models fail at even relatively easy symbol mapping tasks. As demonstrated\\nin Section 5, for even symbolic reasoning tasks that only require generalization to new examples\\nusing the same chain of thought logical structure that was given in the few-shot exemplars, small\\nlanguage models still failed. The second observation is that small language models seem to have\\ninherently weaker arithmetic abilities, as shown by Brown et al. (2020), the ability to do simple\\narithmetic operations (without semantic understanding) requires suf\\ufb01cient model scale.

Future work could more thoroughly\\ninvestigate what properties of pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization objective causally\\nenable such reasoning capabilities.\\n16\\n\\nA Frequently Asked Questions\\nA.1 Why does increasing model scale improve chain-of-thought prompting?\\nThe \\ufb01nding that successful chain-of-thought reasoning predictably emerges only at certain model\\nscales is intriguing. Scaling up language models has been shown to confer bene\\ufb01ts such as improved\\nperformance and sample ef\\ufb01ciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The \\u201cother category\\u201d included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of errors in all\\nthree categories. Examples of semantic understanding and one-step missing errors that were \\ufb01xed by\\nscaling PaLM to 540B are given in Figure 10. This result appears consistent with a hypothesis that\\nlanguage models acquire a range of semantic understanding and logical reasoning skills as a function\\nof model scale (though note that model scale is often con\\ufb02ated with other factors, such as amount of\\ntraining compute).\\nSemantic understanding\\n(62B made 20 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 6 of them)One step missing\\n(62B made 18 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 12 of them)Other\\n(62B made 7 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 4 of them)Types of errors made by a 62B language model:Errors \\ufb01xed by scaling from 62B to 540B\\nFigure 9: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. These errors were categorized\\nthat semantic understanding, one step missing, and other. The other category includes hallucinations,\\nrepetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. Scaling PaLM to 540B \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of\\nerrors in all categories.\\nThere are also three notable points regarding why small language models fail. The \\ufb01rst observation\\nis that small language models fail at even relatively easy symbol mapping tasks. As demonstrated\\nin Section 5, for even symbolic reasoning tasks that only require generalization to new examples\\nusing the same chain of thought logical structure that was given in the few-shot exemplars, small\\nlanguage models still failed. The second observation is that small language models seem to have\\ninherently weaker arithmetic abilities, as shown by Brown et al. (2020), the ability to do simple\\narithmetic operations (without semantic understanding) requires suf\\ufb01cient model scale. Finally, we\\nnoticed qualitatively that small language models often did not generate a \\ufb01nal answer that could be\\nparsed, due to either repetitions or logic that never arrived at a \\ufb01nal answer.\\nIn summary, the success of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale is a complicated\\nphenomena that likely involves a variety of emergent abilities (semantic understanding, symbol\\nmapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc). Future work could more thoroughly\\ninvestigate what properties of pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization objective causally\\nenable such reasoning capabilities.\\n16"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined based on the text."}], "model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.5}' message='Post details'

Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication. From\\nthe perspective of a single neuron, this can be written as:\\n[\\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56]=\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\u210e(n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56\\u00b7[\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,1]\\ud835\\udc47).

The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined based on the text."}], "model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.9}' message='Post details'

Actual neural network operations are far more complex and may not directly map to this kind of step-by-step reasoning process. The text also mentions that the success of chain-of-thought reasoning is a result of model scale and involves a variety of emergent abilities, which may not be captured in this reimagined view of a neuron."})

As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron.

With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term. Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication.

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems.

We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself.

As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments.

In this scenario (of universal computation), it can be useful to study things from the other end,\\ni.e., what will be the resources required to represent a speci\\ufb01c percept. Resources are typically of two \\ufb02avors:\\n(i) the computational cost in terms of cycles (time) and memory (space), and (ii) the length of the description\\nof the percept using the language.\\nThe computational cost is studied in the \\ufb01eld of computational complexity. Problems (and thereby, their\\nsolutions as a sequence of instructions based on symbols), are classi\\ufb01ed into di\\ufb00erent classes [27] based on the\\nscaling behavior of time and space with the size of the problem. Some common ones are polynomial time (P),\\nnon-deterministic polynomial time (NP) and bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP).\\nThe length of description quanti\\ufb01es the Kolmogorov complexity [28] or algorithmic entropy of the percept.\\nIt is de\\ufb01ned as KU(X)=minp{\\u2113(p)\\u2236U(p)=x}, where\\u2113denotes the length of the (pre\\ufb01x-free) program p\\non the encoding used by the universal Turing machine Uthat outputs x. Though it depends on the choice\\nof the building blocks and their encodings, the dependence is only of an additive constant term (called the\\ninvariance theorem) which is the length of a cross-compiler to another language/automata. Thus, it is useful\\nto use Kolmogorov complexity to quantify the individual complexity of a string, irrespective of an ensemble.\\nHowever, \\ufb01nding the exact value is uncomputable. There are many ways to approach it from the upper side\\n(lower semi-computable), for example, via compression algorithms, minimum description length and the block\\ndecomposition method.\\nSo far we reviewed three di\\ufb00erent notions of complexity of states:\\n1. Statistical complexity: Shannon entropy on an ensemble of states (given its probability distribution)\\n2. Computational complexity: Space-time scaling behavior of a program to generate the state (given a\\nlanguage)\\n3. Algorithmic complexity: Length of the program to generate the state (given a language)\\nIn this research, we are instead interested in the circuit complexity of a state. Circuit complexity is related\\nto algorithmic complexity [29], which in turn is related to statistical [30] and computational complexities [31].\\nComputational complexities typically deal with asymptotic scaling behavior and provides lower bounds. Though\\nfamilies of circuits have speci\\ufb01c complexity class hierarchy (e.g., ACi,TCi,NCi) it is not of much interest for\\nthis research. We will focus on circuits with bounded size (in both space and time). Similarly, the expected\\nKolmogorov complexity has been shown to correspond to the Shannon entropy [30], though this relation is not\\nof immediate importance to this work. [29] Kolmogorov complexity can be shown being very similar to circuit\\ncomplexity under certain considerations [29]. Another similar relation is that truth tables of functions with\\nsmall circuit complexity has small Kolmogorov complexity. Counting arguments relating circuit, algorithmic\\nand statistical complexities has been suggested in [15, 16] in terms of Lagrangian action. Our research in\\nanother step in this rather niche \\ufb01eld of understanding observed states via di\\ufb00erent perspectives.\\nIt is important to note that most research on algorithmic information theory has been in the context of\\nuniversal automata, e.g. Turing machines, lambda calculus, cellular automata, etc. The size of the description\\ndepends on how expressive the symbols are for the transformations. What we described so far, i.e., transfor-\\nmations as a relation between two states, is typically the case in the language of circuits. Program written\\nin more abstract logical framework allow more powerful primitives, like universal and existential quanti\\ufb01ers in\\n\\ufb01rst-order or higher-order logic. Typically, an universal computation model demands a recursively enumerable\\nlanguage. In the Chomsky hierarchy, Turing machines are more powerful than linear-bounded automata, which\\nare inturn more powerful than push-down automata and in turn, \\ufb01nite-state machines (FSM). See [32] for a\\ncomparison of these for both classical and quantum computing models. However, for less powerful automata\\nand language models, it is possible to derive corresponding notions [33] of algorithmic complexity. This is\\nimportant as programs written in Turing-complete languages eventually gets translated via the layers of the\\ncomputing stack and gets executed by logic circuits. These logic circuits are however a combination of sequential\\n(allowing memory cells) and combinatorial logic, and can be used to simulate an FSM. Purely combinatorial\\nlogic (not to be confused with combinatory logic, which is universal) is of even lower power than FSM. The\\nformer is loopless and stateless, and thereby is a direct representation of the output state based on the input.\\nIt is important to note that, program execution is typically clocked in both classical and quantum processors\\nto prevent race-conditions, even if the circuits are purely composed of combinatorial logic elements.

The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the \\ufb01nal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model\\u2019s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in suf\\ufb01ciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example.

The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the \\ufb01nal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model\\u2019s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in suf\\ufb01ciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting.

Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters.

As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron.

One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer.

The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters.

Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on.

In this scenario (of universal computation), it can be useful to study things from the other end,\\ni.e., what will be the resources required to represent a speci\\ufb01c percept. Resources are typically of two \\ufb02avors:\\n(i) the computational cost in terms of cycles (time) and memory (space), and (ii) the length of the description\\nof the percept using the language.\\nThe computational cost is studied in the \\ufb01eld of computational complexity. Problems (and thereby, their\\nsolutions as a sequence of instructions based on symbols), are classi\\ufb01ed into di\\ufb00erent classes [27] based on the\\nscaling behavior of time and space with the size of the problem. Some common ones are polynomial time (P),\\nnon-deterministic polynomial time (NP) and bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP).\\nThe length of description quanti\\ufb01es the Kolmogorov complexity [28] or algorithmic entropy of the percept.\\nIt is de\\ufb01ned as KU(X)=minp{\\u2113(p)\\u2236U(p)=x}, where\\u2113denotes the length of the (pre\\ufb01x-free) program p\\non the encoding used by the universal Turing machine Uthat outputs x. Though it depends on the choice\\nof the building blocks and their encodings, the dependence is only of an additive constant term (called the\\ninvariance theorem) which is the length of a cross-compiler to another language/automata. Thus, it is useful\\nto use Kolmogorov complexity to quantify the individual complexity of a string, irrespective of an ensemble.\\nHowever, \\ufb01nding the exact value is uncomputable. There are many ways to approach it from the upper side\\n(lower semi-computable), for example, via compression algorithms, minimum description length and the block\\ndecomposition method.\\nSo far we reviewed three di\\ufb00erent notions of complexity of states:\\n1. Statistical complexity: Shannon entropy on an ensemble of states (given its probability distribution)\\n2. Computational complexity: Space-time scaling behavior of a program to generate the state (given a\\nlanguage)\\n3. Algorithmic complexity: Length of the program to generate the state (given a language)\\nIn this research, we are instead interested in the circuit complexity of a state. Circuit complexity is related\\nto algorithmic complexity [29], which in turn is related to statistical [30] and computational complexities [31].\\nComputational complexities typically deal with asymptotic scaling behavior and provides lower bounds. Though\\nfamilies of circuits have speci\\ufb01c complexity class hierarchy (e.g., ACi,TCi,NCi) it is not of much interest for\\nthis research. We will focus on circuits with bounded size (in both space and time). Similarly, the expected\\nKolmogorov complexity has been shown to correspond to the Shannon entropy [30], though this relation is not\\nof immediate importance to this work. [29] Kolmogorov complexity can be shown being very similar to circuit\\ncomplexity under certain considerations [29]. Another similar relation is that truth tables of functions with\\nsmall circuit complexity has small Kolmogorov complexity. Counting arguments relating circuit, algorithmic\\nand statistical complexities has been suggested in [15, 16] in terms of Lagrangian action. Our research in\\nanother step in this rather niche \\ufb01eld of understanding observed states via di\\ufb00erent perspectives.\\nIt is important to note that most research on algorithmic information theory has been in the context of\\nuniversal automata, e.g. Turing machines, lambda calculus, cellular automata, etc. The size of the description\\ndepends on how expressive the symbols are for the transformations. What we described so far, i.e., transfor-\\nmations as a relation between two states, is typically the case in the language of circuits. Program written\\nin more abstract logical framework allow more powerful primitives, like universal and existential quanti\\ufb01ers in\\n\\ufb01rst-order or higher-order logic. Typically, an universal computation model demands a recursively enumerable\\nlanguage. In the Chomsky hierarchy, Turing machines are more powerful than linear-bounded automata, which\\nare inturn more powerful than push-down automata and in turn, \\ufb01nite-state machines (FSM). See [32] for a\\ncomparison of these for both classical and quantum computing models. However, for less powerful automata\\nand language models, it is possible to derive corresponding notions [33] of algorithmic complexity. This is\\nimportant as programs written in Turing-complete languages eventually gets translated via the layers of the\\ncomputing stack and gets executed by logic circuits. These logic circuits are however a combination of sequential\\n(allowing memory cells) and combinatorial logic, and can be used to simulate an FSM. Purely combinatorial\\nlogic (not to be confused with combinatory logic, which is universal) is of even lower power than FSM.

The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the \\ufb01nal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model\\u2019s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in suf\\ufb01ciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al.

The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the \\ufb01nal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model\\u2019s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in suf\\ufb01ciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting.

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself.

The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize.

For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ).

As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer.

As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network. Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on. Whether a pattern is de-\\ntectable depends on the expressiveness of the function. With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term. Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication. From\\nthe perspective of a single neuron, this can be written as:\\n[\\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56]=\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\u210e(n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56\\u00b7[\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,1]\\ud835\\udc47).

The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities.

This produced models that represented\\nwords in context, such as GPT [Radford et al .2018], ELMo [Peters et al .2018], and ULMFiT [Howard\\nand Ruder 2018].4\\nThe next wave of developments in self-supervised learning \\u2014 BERT [Devlin et al .2019] GPT-2\\n[Radford et al .2019], RoBERTa [Liu et al .2019], T5 [Raffel et al .2019], BART [Lewis et al .2020a] \\u2014\\nquickly followed, embracing the Transformer architecture, incorporating more powerful deep\\nbidirectional encoders of sentences, and scaling up to larger models and datasets.\\nWhile one can view this last wave of technical developments purely through the lens of self-\\nsupervised learning, there was a sociological inflection point around the introduction of BERT.\\nBefore 2019, self-supervised learning with language models was essentially a subarea in NLP, which\\nprogressed in parallel to other developments in NLP. After 2019, self-supervised learning with\\nlanguage models became more of a substrate of NLP, as using BERT has become the norm. The\\nacceptance that a single model could be useful for such a wide range of tasks marks the beginning\\nof the era of foundation models.\\nFoundation models have led to an unprecedented level of homogenization : Almost all state-of-\\nthe-art NLP models are now adapted from one of a few foundation models, such as BERT, RoBERTa,\\nBART, T5, etc. While this homogenization produces extremely high leverage (any improvements in\\nthe foundation models can lead to immediate benefits across all of NLP), it is also a liability; all AI\\nsystems might inherit the same problematic biases of a few foundation models [Bolukbasi et al .\\n2016; Caliskan et al .2017; Abid et al .2021, inter alia ]) \\u2014 see \\u00a75.1: fairness , \\u00a75.6: ethics for further\\ndiscussion.\\nWe are also beginning to see a homogenization across research communities. For example, similar\\nTransformer-based sequence modeling approaches are now applied to text [Devlin et al .2019;\\nRadford et al .2019; Raffel et al .2019], images [Dosovitskiy et al .2020; Chen et al .2020d], speech [Liu\\net al.2020d], tabular data [Yin et al .2020], protein sequences [Rives et al .2021], organic molecules\\n[Rothchild et al .2021], and reinforcement learning [Chen et al .2021b; Janner et al .2021]. These\\nexamples point to a possible future where we have a unified set of tools for developing foundation\\nmodels across a wide range of modalities [Tamkin et al. 2021b].\\nBesides the homogenization of approaches, we also see the homogenization of actual models\\nacross research communities in the form of multimodal models \\u2014 e.g., foundation models trained\\non language and vision data [Luo et al .2020; Kim et al .2021a; Cho et al .2021; Ramesh et al .2021;\\nRadford et al .2021]. Data is naturally multimodal in some domains\\u2014e.g., medical images, structured\\ndata, clinical text in healthcare (\\u00a73.1: healthcare ). Thus, multimodal foundation models are a\\nnatural way of fusing all the relevant information about a domain, and adapting to tasks that also\\nspan multiple modes (Figure 2).\\nFoundation models have also led to surprising emergence which results from scale. For example,\\nGPT-3 [Brown et al .2020], with 175 billion parameters compared to GPT-2\\u2019s 1.5 billion, permits\\nin-context learning , in which the language model can be adapted to a downstream task simply by\\nproviding it with a prompt (a natural language description of the task), an emergent property that\\nwas neither specifically trained for nor anticipated to arise.\\n4The prescient work of Collobert and Weston [2008] is related: they trained on a scalable task akin to masked language\\nmodeling jointly with downstream tasks, rather than producing a single foundation model that can be adapted after the fact\\nto downstream tasks."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined based on the text."}], "model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.5}' message='Post details'

Given the reference to quantum algorithms and quantum environments, a neuron might be conceptualized not just as a binary entity (excited or not excited), but as a quantum entity that can exist in multiple states at once due to quantum superposition.\n\nFurthermore, the neuron could be imagined as operating based on principles of causal inference and universal distribution, fundamentally linked to its 'landscape of quantum programs'. This could potentially allow the neuron to not only process information, but also to understand cause-effect relationships and probability distributions in a more sophisticated manner.\n\nAdditionally, the novelty seeking aspect mentioned in the text could be incorporated into the neuron, encouraging it to explore new paths and connections, thereby potentially increasing the overall learning and adaptation of the artificial neural network. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that such reimagining brings both potential benefits and challenges in terms of computational requirements and the fundamental understanding of how such quantum-inspired neural networks could be practically implemented and trained.", 'agent_norbert': 'The text does not provide information on how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined.', 'agent_cot': "Based on the text, a neuron in a neural network could be reimagined as an entity capable of chain-of-thought reasoning. Traditionally, a neuron in a neural network takes in inputs, applies a weight to them, and passes them through an activation function to produce an output. In the context of this text, a neuron could be conceptualized as a processing unit that not only performs these operations but also contributes to a larger chain of thought or reasoning process.\n\nThis could involve the neuron maintaining some form of context or state information to allow it to contribute to multi-step problem solving. For instance, in the process of solving a math word problem, different neurons or groups of neurons might be responsible for different intermediate steps in the problem-solving process.\n\nAdditionally, it might be useful to imagine the neuron as having the ability to allocate additional computation to problems requiring more reasoning steps, as mentioned in the text. This could be seen as the neuron dynamically adjusting its processing power or level of detail based on the complexity of the task at hand.\n\nFinally, the neuron could be conceptualized as having the ability to provide insight into its own decision-making process. This could involve the neuron producing some form of interpretable output that shows how it arrived at a particular decision, providing an opportunity for debugging or improving the model's reasoning capabilities. \n\nIt's important to note that these are conceptual changes and implementing them in a practical setting would require significant advancements in our understanding and design of neural networks."})

In this scenario (of universal computation), it can be useful to study things from the other end,\\ni.e., what will be the resources required to represent a speci\\ufb01c percept. Resources are typically of two \\ufb02avors:\\n(i) the computational cost in terms of cycles (time) and memory (space), and (ii) the length of the description\\nof the percept using the language.\\nThe computational cost is studied in the \\ufb01eld of computational complexity. Problems (and thereby, their\\nsolutions as a sequence of instructions based on symbols), are classi\\ufb01ed into di\\ufb00erent classes [27] based on the\\nscaling behavior of time and space with the size of the problem. Some common ones are polynomial time (P),\\nnon-deterministic polynomial time (NP) and bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP).\\nThe length of description quanti\\ufb01es the Kolmogorov complexity [28] or algorithmic entropy of the percept.\\nIt is de\\ufb01ned as KU(X)=minp{\\u2113(p)\\u2236U(p)=x}, where\\u2113denotes the length of the (pre\\ufb01x-free) program p\\non the encoding used by the universal Turing machine Uthat outputs x. Though it depends on the choice\\nof the building blocks and their encodings, the dependence is only of an additive constant term (called the\\ninvariance theorem) which is the length of a cross-compiler to another language/automata. Thus, it is useful\\nto use Kolmogorov complexity to quantify the individual complexity of a string, irrespective of an ensemble.\\nHowever, \\ufb01nding the exact value is uncomputable. There are many ways to approach it from the upper side\\n(lower semi-computable), for example, via compression algorithms, minimum description length and the block\\ndecomposition method.\\nSo far we reviewed three di\\ufb00erent notions of complexity of states:\\n1. Statistical complexity: Shannon entropy on an ensemble of states (given its probability distribution)\\n2. Computational complexity: Space-time scaling behavior of a program to generate the state (given a\\nlanguage)\\n3. Algorithmic complexity: Length of the program to generate the state (given a language)\\nIn this research, we are instead interested in the circuit complexity of a state. Circuit complexity is related\\nto algorithmic complexity [29], which in turn is related to statistical [30] and computational complexities [31].\\nComputational complexities typically deal with asymptotic scaling behavior and provides lower bounds. Though\\nfamilies of circuits have speci\\ufb01c complexity class hierarchy (e.g., ACi,TCi,NCi) it is not of much interest for\\nthis research. We will focus on circuits with bounded size (in both space and time). Similarly, the expected\\nKolmogorov complexity has been shown to correspond to the Shannon entropy [30], though this relation is not\\nof immediate importance to this work. [29] Kolmogorov complexity can be shown being very similar to circuit\\ncomplexity under certain considerations [29]. Another similar relation is that truth tables of functions with\\nsmall circuit complexity has small Kolmogorov complexity. Counting arguments relating circuit, algorithmic\\nand statistical complexities has been suggested in [15, 16] in terms of Lagrangian action. Our research in\\nanother step in this rather niche \\ufb01eld of understanding observed states via di\\ufb00erent perspectives.\\nIt is important to note that most research on algorithmic information theory has been in the context of\\nuniversal automata, e.g. Turing machines, lambda calculus, cellular automata, etc. The size of the description\\ndepends on how expressive the symbols are for the transformations. What we described so far, i.e., transfor-\\nmations as a relation between two states, is typically the case in the language of circuits. Program written\\nin more abstract logical framework allow more powerful primitives, like universal and existential quanti\\ufb01ers in\\n\\ufb01rst-order or higher-order logic.

The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the \\ufb01nal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model\\u2019s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in suf\\ufb01ciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models.

Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right).

The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the \\ufb01nal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model\\u2019s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in suf\\ufb01ciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ).

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network.

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer.

Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize.

These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself.

As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network. Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on. Whether a pattern is de-\\ntectable depends on the expressiveness of the function. With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term. Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication. From\\nthe perspective of a single neuron, this can be written as:\\n[\\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56]=\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\u210e(n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56\\u00b7[\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,1]\\ud835\\udc47).

The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron.

This produced models that represented\\nwords in context, such as GPT [Radford et al .2018], ELMo [Peters et al .2018], and ULMFiT [Howard\\nand Ruder 2018].4\\nThe next wave of developments in self-supervised learning \\u2014 BERT [Devlin et al .2019] GPT-2\\n[Radford et al .2019], RoBERTa [Liu et al .2019], T5 [Raffel et al .2019], BART [Lewis et al .2020a] \\u2014\\nquickly followed, embracing the Transformer architecture, incorporating more powerful deep\\nbidirectional encoders of sentences, and scaling up to larger models and datasets.\\nWhile one can view this last wave of technical developments purely through the lens of self-\\nsupervised learning, there was a sociological inflection point around the introduction of BERT.\\nBefore 2019, self-supervised learning with language models was essentially a subarea in NLP, which\\nprogressed in parallel to other developments in NLP. After 2019, self-supervised learning with\\nlanguage models became more of a substrate of NLP, as using BERT has become the norm. The\\nacceptance that a single model could be useful for such a wide range of tasks marks the beginning\\nof the era of foundation models.\\nFoundation models have led to an unprecedented level of homogenization : Almost all state-of-\\nthe-art NLP models are now adapted from one of a few foundation models, such as BERT, RoBERTa,\\nBART, T5, etc. While this homogenization produces extremely high leverage (any improvements in\\nthe foundation models can lead to immediate benefits across all of NLP), it is also a liability; all AI\\nsystems might inherit the same problematic biases of a few foundation models [Bolukbasi et al .\\n2016; Caliskan et al .2017; Abid et al .2021, inter alia ]) \\u2014 see \\u00a75.1: fairness , \\u00a75.6: ethics for further\\ndiscussion.\\nWe are also beginning to see a homogenization across research communities. For example, similar\\nTransformer-based sequence modeling approaches are now applied to text [Devlin et al .2019;\\nRadford et al .2019; Raffel et al .2019], images [Dosovitskiy et al .2020; Chen et al .2020d], speech [Liu\\net al.2020d], tabular data [Yin et al .2020], protein sequences [Rives et al .2021], organic molecules\\n[Rothchild et al .2021], and reinforcement learning [Chen et al .2021b; Janner et al .2021]. These\\nexamples point to a possible future where we have a unified set of tools for developing foundation\\nmodels across a wide range of modalities [Tamkin et al. 2021b].\\nBesides the homogenization of approaches, we also see the homogenization of actual models\\nacross research communities in the form of multimodal models \\u2014 e.g., foundation models trained\\non language and vision data [Luo et al .2020; Kim et al .2021a; Cho et al .2021; Ramesh et al .2021;\\nRadford et al .2021]. Data is naturally multimodal in some domains\\u2014e.g., medical images, structured\\ndata, clinical text in healthcare (\\u00a73.1: healthcare ). Thus, multimodal foundation models are a\\nnatural way of fusing all the relevant information about a domain, and adapting to tasks that also\\nspan multiple modes (Figure 2).\\nFoundation models have also led to surprising emergence which results from scale. For example,\\nGPT-3 [Brown et al .2020], with 175 billion parameters compared to GPT-2\\u2019s 1.5 billion, permits\\nin-context learning , in which the language model can be adapted to a downstream task simply by\\nproviding it with a prompt (a natural language description of the task), an emergent property that\\nwas neither specifically trained for nor anticipated to arise.\\n4The prescient work of Collobert and Weston [2008] is related: they trained on a scalable task akin to masked language\\nmodeling jointly with downstream tasks, rather than producing a single foundation model that can be adapted after the fact\\nto downstream tasks."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined based on the text."}], "model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.5}' message='Post details'

Now I speak of seven. An explanation seems to be in order. \\nThe answer really is simple. The full theory of action is not yet in existence, but whatev - \\ner its form, it involves a continuum of stages on both the action/execution side and the \\nperception/evaluation side. The notion of stages is a simplification of the underlying \\ntheory: I do not believe that there really are clean, separable stages. However, for prac- \\ntical application, approximating the activity into stages seems reasonable and useful. Just \\nwhat division of stages should be made, however, seems less clear. In my original for- \\nmulations, I suggested four stages: intention, action sequence, execution, and evaluation. \\nIn this chapter I separated goals and intentions and expanded the analysis of evaluation \\nby adding perception and interpretation, thus making the stages of evaluation correspond \\nbetter with the stages of execution: Perception is the evaluatory equivalent of execution, \\ninterpretation the equivalent of the action sequence, and evaluation the equivalent of \\nforming the intention. The present formulation seems a richer, more satisfactory \\nanalysis. \\n\\n3.

It would be trained using self-supervised learning techniques, such as predicting the next word given the previous words, and could be part of a larger Transformer architecture. This neuron would be capable of processing a wide range of data types, from text to images to speech, thanks to the homogenization of approaches across research communities. It could also be part of a multimodal model, processing multiple types of data simultaneously. Furthermore, this neuron could be capable of in-context learning, adapting to a downstream task simply by being provided with a natural language description of the task. However, it would also need to be carefully monitored for biases, as any problematic biases in the foundation model could be inherited by all AI systems that use it.', 'agent_quant': "Based on the context given about quantum processes and artificial intelligence, a neuron in a neural network could be reimagined as a quantum system, where the connections between neurons would no longer be constrained to binary states (active/inactive, or 1/0), but could exist in a superposition of states. This can significantly increase the computational capacity of each neuron and the network as a whole. \n\nThe neuron's activation function, which determines the output of a neuron, could potentially leverage quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, potentially allowing for more complex and dynamic neuron behaviors. \n\nAdditionally, concepts such as causal inference could be integrated into the network, enabling a neuron to better understand and map cause-effect relations in its inputs and outputs. The neuron could be programmed to seek novelty in its learning process, which could support the development of more complex and adaptive learning mechanisms. \n\nThis interpretation also implies that the structure of the artificial neuron itself could be dynamic and adaptive, changing its connections, or even its internal operations, based on the data it encounters. This direction of automated quantum operational theory could potentially revolutionize how neural networks are designed and implemented. However, implementing such quantum-inspired models and algorithms in actual hardware would be a significant challenge.", 'agent_norbert': "The text doesn't provide specific information on how a neuron for a neural network could be reimagined. However, drawing from the seven stages of user activity, one could potentially conceptualize a neuron in a neural network as having similar stages. For instance, the neuron could have a stage for establishing a goal (determining its function within the network), forming an intention (deciding how to achieve that function), specifying an action sequence (determining the steps it needs to take), executing the action (performing its function), perceiving the system state (taking in feedback from the network), interpreting the state (analyzing the feedback), and evaluating the system state with respect to the goals and intentions (adjusting its function based on the feedback). This is purely speculative and would require further research and development to implement.", 'agent_cot': "Based on the text, a neuron in a neural network could be reimagined to facilitate chain-of-thought reasoning. In this context, each neuron would not only process information based on its inputs and weights but would also maintain a form of 'memory' or 'state' that represents the intermediate steps of reasoning. \n\nThis could involve decomposing multi-step problems into intermediate steps, with each neuron contributing to a particular step in the reasoning process. The output of the neuron could then be an intermediate result that is passed onto the next neuron in the chain for further processing.\n\nMoreover, the neuron could also be designed to provide an interpretable window into its operation, revealing how it contributed to the overall reasoning process. This could help in debugging where the reasoning path might have gone wrong.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a conceptual interpretation. In practice, implementing such a neuron in a neural network would require significant changes to the current architectures and training methodologies."})

As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron.

As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron.

The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters.

Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on. Whether a pattern is de-\\ntectable depends on the expressiveness of the function. With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term. Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication.

Though it depends on the choice\\nof the building blocks and their encodings, the dependence is only of an additive constant term (called the\\ninvariance theorem) which is the length of a cross-compiler to another language/automata. Thus, it is useful\\nto use Kolmogorov complexity to quantify the individual complexity of a string, irrespective of an ensemble.\\nHowever, \\ufb01nding the exact value is uncomputable. There are many ways to approach it from the upper side\\n(lower semi-computable), for example, via compression algorithms, minimum description length and the block\\ndecomposition method.\\nSo far we reviewed three di\\ufb00erent notions of complexity of states:\\n1. Statistical complexity: Shannon entropy on an ensemble of states (given its probability distribution)\\n2. Computational complexity: Space-time scaling behavior of a program to generate the state (given a\\nlanguage)\\n3. Algorithmic complexity: Length of the program to generate the state (given a language)\\nIn this research, we are instead interested in the circuit complexity of a state. Circuit complexity is related\\nto algorithmic complexity [29], which in turn is related to statistical [30] and computational complexities [31].\\nComputational complexities typically deal with asymptotic scaling behavior and provides lower bounds. Though\\nfamilies of circuits have speci\\ufb01c complexity class hierarchy (e.g., ACi,TCi,NCi) it is not of much interest for\\nthis research. We will focus on circuits with bounded size (in both space and time). Similarly, the expected\\nKolmogorov complexity has been shown to correspond to the Shannon entropy [30], though this relation is not\\nof immediate importance to this work. [29] Kolmogorov complexity can be shown being very similar to circuit\\ncomplexity under certain considerations [29]. Another similar relation is that truth tables of functions with\\nsmall circuit complexity has small Kolmogorov complexity. Counting arguments relating circuit, algorithmic\\nand statistical complexities has been suggested in [15, 16] in terms of Lagrangian action. Our research in\\nanother step in this rather niche \\ufb01eld of understanding observed states via di\\ufb00erent perspectives.\\nIt is important to note that most research on algorithmic information theory has been in the context of\\nuniversal automata, e.g. Turing machines, lambda calculus, cellular automata, etc. The size of the description\\ndepends on how expressive the symbols are for the transformations. What we described so far, i.e., transfor-\\nmations as a relation between two states, is typically the case in the language of circuits. Program written\\nin more abstract logical framework allow more powerful primitives, like universal and existential quanti\\ufb01ers in\\n\\ufb01rst-order or higher-order logic. Typically, an universal computation model demands a recursively enumerable\\nlanguage. In the Chomsky hierarchy, Turing machines are more powerful than linear-bounded automata, which\\nare inturn more powerful than push-down automata and in turn, \\ufb01nite-state machines (FSM). See [32] for a\\ncomparison of these for both classical and quantum computing models. However, for less powerful automata\\nand language models, it is possible to derive corresponding notions [33] of algorithmic complexity. This is\\nimportant as programs written in Turing-complete languages eventually gets translated via the layers of the\\ncomputing stack and gets executed by logic circuits. These logic circuits are however a combination of sequential\\n(allowing memory cells) and combinatorial logic, and can be used to simulate an FSM. Purely combinatorial\\nlogic (not to be confused with combinatory logic, which is universal) is of even lower power than FSM. The\\nformer is loopless and stateless, and thereby is a direct representation of the output state based on the input.\\nIt is important to note that, program execution is typically clocked in both classical and quantum processors\\nto prevent race-conditions, even if the circuits are purely composed of combinatorial logic elements. Thus,\\nresources of time and space can be de\\ufb01ned in this setting even without tracking and accessing intermediate\\nstates. By borrowing notions from algorithmic information theory (as de\\ufb01ned on functional programs), in this\\nwork, we study the e\\ufb00ect of circuit complexity of Boolean/quantum combinatorial logic on state complexity.\\n3 Landscape of circuits\\nWith this background of the measures of complexity, let us now \\ufb01rst explore the landscape of Boolean circuits.\\nThe quantum circuit model is inspired by and is a generalization of the Boolean circuit model, so, it would be\\nnatural to start with a classical model and generalize it to the corresponding quantum formulation.\\n4\\n\\nin computers.

The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the \\ufb01nal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model\\u2019s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in suf\\ufb01ciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting\\u2014Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20.

To investigate whether\\nchain-of-thought prompting in this form can successfully elicit successful reasoning across a range of\\n3\\n\\nlanguage models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are\\nprovided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.\\nFigure 1 shows an example of a model producing a chain of thought to solve a math word problem\\nthat it would have otherwise gotten incorrect. The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the \\ufb01nal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model\\u2019s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in suf\\ufb01ciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting\\u2014Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer bene\\ufb01ts such as improved\\nperformance and sample ef\\ufb01ciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The \\u201cother category\\u201d included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer bene\\ufb01ts such as improved\\nperformance and sample ef\\ufb01ciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The \\u201cother category\\u201d included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors.

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer.

The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters.

To further expand the applicability of quantum algorithms, techniques from novelty search [62]\\nand large language models [63] can be incorporated into these automation engines. Open-ended search in the\\nspace of quantum processes can greatly bene\\ufb01t from a characterization of this landscape, as presented in this\\nwork.\\n5.3 Quantum arti\\ufb01cial general intelligence\\nAmong the more rigorous methods of developing general intelligence is an active formulation of Solomono\\ufb00\\u2019s\\ntheory of inductive intelligence [34], called universal arti\\ufb01cial intelligence [18]. Universal reinforcement learning\\nmodels like AIXI and KSA are capable of rational decision-making or modelling environmental dynamics, based\\non the shortest program that corresponds to compressing the past observations and maximizing a set reward\\nfunction. These have been quantized both by using quantum algorithms, (e.g., in the AIXI-q model [64]) and\\nby applying them to quantum environments (e.g., in the QKSA model [65]).\\nAnother crucial aspect of intelligence [66] is the understanding of cause-e\\ufb00ect relations. Quantum acceler-\\nation of causal inference [67, 68, 69] can bene\\ufb01t from the knowledge of the probability distribution of causal\\noracles, a subset of quantum processes that embed speci\\ufb01c properties of the problem. Besides causal inference,\\nsimilar techniques can be applied to other statistical relational learning applications like probabilistic logic\\nnetworks [70] and quantum variational algorithms.\\nBoth universal distribution and causal inference are intimately connected to the landscape of quantum\\nprograms. This landscape inturn depends on the choice of a speci\\ufb01c gate set, as we saw in this research.\\nThereby, novelty seeking in the space of universal gate sets can meta-optimize quantum program synthesis\\nfor speci\\ufb01c application algorithms. In our current research, we are exploring this direction of second-order\\ncybernetics of automated quantum operational theory, by using the groundwork developed in this article.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis project was initiated under the QIntern 2021 project \\u201cReinforcement Learning Agent for Quantum\\nFoundations\\u201d.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer bene\\ufb01ts such as improved\\nperformance and sample ef\\ufb01ciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The \\u201cother category\\u201d included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer bene\\ufb01ts such as improved\\nperformance and sample ef\\ufb01ciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The \\u201cother category\\u201d included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of errors in all\\nthree categories.

One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean.\\nAnother one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. How many penguins are still left sunbathing?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BY CHANCE ):There are 36 penguins. One-third of them jump in and swim in\\nthe ocean. So that is 12 penguins. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. So that is 12 penguins.\\nThe answer is 12.\\nQUESTION :John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each. Each bedroom has 2 windows each. There are an\\nadditional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. How many total windows are there between the\\nhouses?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT UNDERSPECIFIED STATEMENTS ):There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms\\neach. Each bedroom has 2 windows each. So there are 2 x 3 = 6 windows in each house. There are an additional\\n4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. So there are 4 + 4 = 8 windows in each house. So there are\\n6 x 2 = 12 windows in each house. So there are 12 + 8 = 20 windows in both houses. The answer is 20.\\nQUESTION :If Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, how old will her brother be in 3 years?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT UNRELATED STATEMENT ):Ann is 9 years old. Her brother is twice her\\nage. So her brother is 18 years old. In 3 years, she will be 12. So her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old. The\\nanswer is 21.\\nQUESTION :A local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon. An app company is offering $.20 cashback per\\ngallon if you \\ufb01ll up at this station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much with their gas be, after the\\ncashback rewards?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT IMPERFECT EQUATION ):The gas is originally 3 dollars per gallon. If\\nyou buy 10 gallons, that is 3 x 10 = 30 dollars. If you get 20 cents off per gallon, that is 20 x 10 = 2 dollars. So\\nthe total is 30 - 2 = 28 dollars.

Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on. Whether a pattern is de-\\ntectable depends on the expressiveness of the function. With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term.

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network.

Shortly thereafter,\\nself-supervised learning based on autoregressive language modeling (predict the next word given\\nthe previous words) [Dai and Le 2015] became popular. This produced models that represented\\nwords in context, such as GPT [Radford et al .2018], ELMo [Peters et al .2018], and ULMFiT [Howard\\nand Ruder 2018].4\\nThe next wave of developments in self-supervised learning \\u2014 BERT [Devlin et al .2019] GPT-2\\n[Radford et al .2019], RoBERTa [Liu et al .2019], T5 [Raffel et al .2019], BART [Lewis et al .2020a] \\u2014\\nquickly followed, embracing the Transformer architecture, incorporating more powerful deep\\nbidirectional encoders of sentences, and scaling up to larger models and datasets.\\nWhile one can view this last wave of technical developments purely through the lens of self-\\nsupervised learning, there was a sociological inflection point around the introduction of BERT.\\nBefore 2019, self-supervised learning with language models was essentially a subarea in NLP, which\\nprogressed in parallel to other developments in NLP.

Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting\\u2014Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20. (These particular exemplars did not undergo\\nprompt engineering; robustness is studied in Section 3.4 and Appendix A.2.) To investigate whether\\nchain-of-thought prompting in this form can successfully elicit successful reasoning across a range of\\n3\\n\\nlanguage models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are\\nprovided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.\\nFigure 1 shows an example of a model producing a chain of thought to solve a math word problem\\nthat it would have otherwise gotten incorrect.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer bene\\ufb01ts such as improved\\nperformance and sample ef\\ufb01ciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The \\u201cother category\\u201d included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of errors in all\\nthree categories. Examples of semantic understanding and one-step missing errors that were \\ufb01xed by\\nscaling PaLM to 540B are given in Figure 10. This result appears consistent with a hypothesis that\\nlanguage models acquire a range of semantic understanding and logical reasoning skills as a function\\nof model scale (though note that model scale is often con\\ufb02ated with other factors, such as amount of\\ntraining compute).\\nSemantic understanding\\n(62B made 20 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 6 of them)One step missing\\n(62B made 18 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 12 of them)Other\\n(62B made 7 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 4 of them)Types of errors made by a 62B language model:Errors \\ufb01xed by scaling from 62B to 540B\\nFigure 9: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. These errors were categorized\\nthat semantic understanding, one step missing, and other. The other category includes hallucinations,\\nrepetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. Scaling PaLM to 540B \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of\\nerrors in all categories.\\nThere are also three notable points regarding why small language models fail. The \\ufb01rst observation\\nis that small language models fail at even relatively easy symbol mapping tasks. As demonstrated\\nin Section 5, for even symbolic reasoning tasks that only require generalization to new examples\\nusing the same chain of thought logical structure that was given in the few-shot exemplars, small\\nlanguage models still failed. The second observation is that small language models seem to have\\ninherently weaker arithmetic abilities, as shown by Brown et al. (2020), the ability to do simple\\narithmetic operations (without semantic understanding) requires suf\\ufb01cient model scale. Finally, we\\nnoticed qualitatively that small language models often did not generate a \\ufb01nal answer that could be\\nparsed, due to either repetitions or logic that never arrived at a \\ufb01nal answer.\\nIn summary, the success of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale is a complicated\\nphenomena that likely involves a variety of emergent abilities (semantic understanding, symbol\\nmapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc).

To investigate whether\\nchain-of-thought prompting in this form can successfully elicit successful reasoning across a range of\\n3\\n\\nlanguage models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are\\nprovided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.\\nFigure 1 shows an example of a model producing a chain of thought to solve a math word problem\\nthat it would have otherwise gotten incorrect. The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the \\ufb01nal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model\\u2019s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in suf\\ufb01ciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting\\u2014Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20.

We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer.

The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined based on the text."}], "model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.9}' message='Post details'

This reimagined neuron can take more than a single value as input and output more than one value. At each time step, the neuron takes in a vector with three elements from the previous layer, which combines the input value, the current state of the neuron, and a bias term. The output is then obtained by the vector-matrix multiplication.\n\nWhat\'s interesting about these neurons is that they are given a "state" that gets integrated with the input through optimized neural parameters. A portion of the neuron\'s output is used to update the state of the neuron, which is then fed back into the neuron with the following input. This characteristic turns these neurons into a kind of small dynamical system or mini recurrent neural networks (RNNs), capable of producing different outputs even when presented with the same input value at different points in its history due to its state variations.\n\nThe new approach enables each layer of neurons to be seen as a set of tiny RNNs, updated uniquely and in parallel with local inputs. Each neuron only affects its own next state and output, thus these local recurrent states rely solely on the small matrix of the neural unit. In other words, the system optimizes six parameters for each neuron in the neural network. This is a departure from traditional ANNs where neurons don\'t constantly update their own state based on their output, enabling this reimagined neuron to provide memory capabilities in a parameter-efficient manner.', 'agent_snd': "The text doesn't provide information on how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined.", 'agent_foundation': "The text doesn't provide specific information on how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined.", 'agent_quant': "Based on the text, a neuron for a neural network in quantum computing could be reimagined as a quantum process. The interactions between these quantum processes, comparable to synaptic connections in a traditional neural network, could be dependent on quantum properties, and could allow for complexity and parallelism far beyond traditional neurons. This neuron could also be capable of a deeper understanding of cause-effect relations, similar to the quantum acceleration of causal inference mentioned in the text.\n\nThis neuron might also incorporate aspects of Solomonoﬀ’s theory of inductive intelligence or universal artificial intelligence. It could be capable of rational decision-making or modelling environmental dynamics, based on the shortest program that corresponds to compressing the past observations and maximizing a set reward function. \n\nLastly, much like the novelty search mentioned in the text, the neuron's functioning and learning might involve exploration in the space of quantum processes or the landscape of quantum programs, allowing it to adapt and optimize its functions according to the specific applications.", 'agent_norbert': "The text doesn't provide specific information on how a neuron for a neural network could be reimagined. However, drawing from the concept of stages of user activities, one could potentially conceptualize a neuron in a neural network as having similar stages. For instance, the neuron could have a stage for receiving input (similar to perceiving the system state), a stage for processing that input (similar to interpreting the state), and a stage for outputting a signal based on that processing (similar to executing the action). The neuron could also have a mechanism for adjusting its processing based on the difference between its output and a desired output (similar to evaluating the system state with respect to the goals and intentions). But this is just a conceptual analogy and the actual implementation would depend on the specifics of the neural network and the problem it is designed to solve.", 'agent_cot': "Based on the text, a neuron in a neural network could be reimagined as a component that not only processes input and generates output, but also maintains a form of 'chain-of-thought' reasoning. This would involve the neuron having the ability to break down complex problems into intermediate steps, similar to how humans solve problems. \n\nIn this scenario, each neuron wouldn't just pass on the processed information, but would also carry forward a 'thought process' that could be interpreted and debugged. This would provide a window into the model's behavior, giving insights into how the model arrived at a particular answer and where the reasoning path may have gone wrong. \n\nMoreover, this neuron would be capable of handling a variety of tasks that require reasoning, like math word problems, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation. It would also be able to learn from examples of chain-of-thought sequences, improving its ability to reason and solve problems over time.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a conceptual interpretation of how neurons could be reimagined based on the text, and implementing such a feature in a neural network would be a complex task."})

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer.

The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network.

One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer.

To further expand the applicability of quantum algorithms, techniques from novelty search [62]\\nand large language models [63] can be incorporated into these automation engines. Open-ended search in the\\nspace of quantum processes can greatly bene\\ufb01t from a characterization of this landscape, as presented in this\\nwork.\\n5.3 Quantum arti\\ufb01cial general intelligence\\nAmong the more rigorous methods of developing general intelligence is an active formulation of Solomono\\ufb00\\u2019s\\ntheory of inductive intelligence [34], called universal arti\\ufb01cial intelligence [18]. Universal reinforcement learning\\nmodels like AIXI and KSA are capable of rational decision-making or modelling environmental dynamics, based\\non the shortest program that corresponds to compressing the past observations and maximizing a set reward\\nfunction. These have been quantized both by using quantum algorithms, (e.g., in the AIXI-q model [64]) and\\nby applying them to quantum environments (e.g., in the QKSA model [65]).\\nAnother crucial aspect of intelligence [66] is the understanding of cause-e\\ufb00ect relations. Quantum acceler-\\nation of causal inference [67, 68, 69] can bene\\ufb01t from the knowledge of the probability distribution of causal\\noracles, a subset of quantum processes that embed speci\\ufb01c properties of the problem. Besides causal inference,\\nsimilar techniques can be applied to other statistical relational learning applications like probabilistic logic\\nnetworks [70] and quantum variational algorithms.\\nBoth universal distribution and causal inference are intimately connected to the landscape of quantum\\nprograms. This landscape inturn depends on the choice of a speci\\ufb01c gate set, as we saw in this research.\\nThereby, novelty seeking in the space of universal gate sets can meta-optimize quantum program synthesis\\nfor speci\\ufb01c application algorithms. In our current research, we are exploring this direction of second-order\\ncybernetics of automated quantum operational theory, by using the groundwork developed in this article.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis project was initiated under the QIntern 2021 project \\u201cReinforcement Learning Agent for Quantum\\nFoundations\\u201d.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer bene\\ufb01ts such as improved\\nperformance and sample ef\\ufb01ciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The \\u201cother category\\u201d included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of errors in all\\nthree categories. Examples of semantic understanding and one-step missing errors that were \\ufb01xed by\\nscaling PaLM to 540B are given in Figure 10. This result appears consistent with a hypothesis that\\nlanguage models acquire a range of semantic understanding and logical reasoning skills as a function\\nof model scale (though note that model scale is often con\\ufb02ated with other factors, such as amount of\\ntraining compute).\\nSemantic understanding\\n(62B made 20 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 6 of them)One step missing\\n(62B made 18 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 12 of them)Other\\n(62B made 7 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 4 of them)Types of errors made by a 62B language model:Errors \\ufb01xed by scaling from 62B to 540B\\nFigure 9: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. These errors were categorized\\nthat semantic understanding, one step missing, and other. The other category includes hallucinations,\\nrepetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. Scaling PaLM to 540B \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of\\nerrors in all categories.\\nThere are also three notable points regarding why small language models fail. The \\ufb01rst observation\\nis that small language models fail at even relatively easy symbol mapping tasks.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer bene\\ufb01ts such as improved\\nperformance and sample ef\\ufb01ciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The \\u201cother category\\u201d included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of errors in all\\nthree categories. Examples of semantic understanding and one-step missing errors that were \\ufb01xed by\\nscaling PaLM to 540B are given in Figure 10. This result appears consistent with a hypothesis that\\nlanguage models acquire a range of semantic understanding and logical reasoning skills as a function\\nof model scale (though note that model scale is often con\\ufb02ated with other factors, such as amount of\\ntraining compute).\\nSemantic understanding\\n(62B made 20 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 6 of them)One step missing\\n(62B made 18 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 12 of them)Other\\n(62B made 7 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 4 of them)Types of errors made by a 62B language model:Errors \\ufb01xed by scaling from 62B to 540B\\nFigure 9: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. These errors were categorized\\nthat semantic understanding, one step missing, and other. The other category includes hallucinations,\\nrepetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. Scaling PaLM to 540B \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of\\nerrors in all categories.\\nThere are also three notable points regarding why small language models fail. The \\ufb01rst observation\\nis that small language models fail at even relatively easy symbol mapping tasks. As demonstrated\\nin Section 5, for even symbolic reasoning tasks that only require generalization to new examples\\nusing the same chain of thought logical structure that was given in the few-shot exemplars, small\\nlanguage models still failed. The second observation is that small language models seem to have\\ninherently weaker arithmetic abilities, as shown by Brown et al. (2020), the ability to do simple\\narithmetic operations (without semantic understanding) requires suf\\ufb01cient model scale. Finally, we\\nnoticed qualitatively that small language models often did not generate a \\ufb01nal answer that could be\\nparsed, due to either repetitions or logic that never arrived at a \\ufb01nal answer.\\nIn summary, the success of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale is a complicated\\nphenomena that likely involves a variety of emergent abilities (semantic understanding, symbol\\nmapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc). Future work could more thoroughly\\ninvestigate what properties of pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization objective causally\\nenable such reasoning capabilities.\\n16"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined based on the text."}], "model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.5}' message='Post details'

Each neuron has a small three-by-two matrix of values, all of which need to be optimized. \n\nEach neural unit is presented with a vector that incorporates three elements at each time step: the input value (which is propagated through a random connection from the prior layer), the current state of the neuron, and a bias term. The neuron integrates the input value with its current state through the optimized neural parameters. \n\nPart of the output of a given neuron becomes the new state of that neuron, and this is fed back to the neuron with the next input. Therefore, the neuron can yield different outputs even when presented with the same input value at different points in its history. This provides the network with some memory capabilities.\n\nThis concept differs from standard RNN architectures in the sense that the state associated with a neuron only impacts the next state and output of that specific neuron, as these states only rely on the small matrix of the neural unit. Therefore, these neurons are more autonomous and individually expressive than in conventional architecture.', 'agent_snd': "The text doesn't provide information on how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined.", 'agent_foundation': "The text doesn't provide specific details on how a neuron for a neural network might be reimagined. However, it discusses the evolution and impact of foundation models, which are large-scale models trained on broad data, in various domains. These models, like BERT, GPT-2, and GPT-3, are based on the Transformer architecture and use self-supervised learning. In this context, a neuron in a neural network might be reimagined as part of a larger, interconnected system where learning is not only based on specific task-related data but also on broader contextual data. Additionally, with the rise of multimodal models, neurons might need to process and integrate different types of data (text, images, etc.), further expanding their role and complexity. However, without more specific information, it's challenging to provide a more detailed answer.", 'agent_quant': "Based on the text, a neuron for a neural network in a quantum framework could be reimagined as a quantum gate within a larger quantum circuit. The 'activation' of this neuron could correspond to the application of a specific quantum gate or sequence of gates. Additionally, the concept of 'weights' in a traditional neural network could analogously be seen as the amplitude of quantum states in this quantum neuron. The understanding and manipulation of cause-effect relations, as discussed in the text, might play a key role in the adjustment and training of these quantum neurons. Just like traditional neurons learn from past observations, quantum neurons might be designed to leverage principles from quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement to perform parallel computation, thereby potentially offering significant speedups.", 'agent_norbert': "The text doesn't provide specific information on how a neuron for a neural network could be reimagined. However, drawing from the seven stages of user activity, one could potentially conceptualize a neuron in a neural network as having similar stages. These could include: receiving an input (Establishing the Goal), processing the input (Forming the Intention), determining the output based on the input and the neuron's activation function (Specifying the Action Sequence), sending the output (Executing the Action), receiving feedback (Perceiving the System State), adjusting based on the feedback (Interpreting the State), and updating the neuron's weights during training (Evaluating the System State with respect to the Goals and Intentions). This is a speculative interpretation and not directly stated in the text.", 'agent_cot': 'The text does not provide specific information on how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined.

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network.

But in doing all this, there is one more problem, one just \\nbeginning to be understood, and one not assisted by the usual forms of \\ndisplays: the problem of level.

Now I speak of seven. An explanation seems to be in order. \\nThe answer really is simple. The full theory of action is not yet in existence, but whatev - \\ner its form, it involves a continuum of stages on both the action/execution side and the \\nperception/evaluation side. The notion of stages is a simplification of the underlying \\ntheory: I do not believe that there really are clean, separable stages. However, for prac- \\ntical application, approximating the activity into stages seems reasonable and useful. Just \\nwhat division of stages should be made, however, seems less clear. In my original for- \\nmulations, I suggested four stages: intention, action sequence, execution, and evaluation. \\nIn this chapter I separated goals and intentions and expanded the analysis of evaluation \\nby adding perception and interpretation, thus making the stages of evaluation correspond \\nbetter with the stages of execution: Perception is the evaluatory equivalent of execution, \\ninterpretation the equivalent of the action sequence, and evaluation the equivalent of \\nforming the intention. The present formulation seems a richer, more satisfactory \\nanalysis. \\n\\n3.

Therefore, the commands would be expected to be used fre- \\nquently. And whenever there is much experience and practice, lack of \\nmeaning and consistency is not so important. Yes, the learning time \\nmight be long, but it only need take place once and then, once the \\ncommands have been learned well, they become automatic, causing no \\nfurther difficulty. Choices of command names are especially critical \\nwhen many different systems are to be used, each with its own cryptic, \\nidiosyncratic choice of names. Problems arise when different systems \\nare involved, oftentimes with similar functions that have different \\nnames and conventions, and with similar names that have different \\nmeanings. When a system is heavily used by beginners or casual users, \\nthen command names take on added significance. \\nPrescriptions for Design Principles \\nWhat is it that we need to do? What should we accomplish? What is \\nthe function of Cognitive Engineering? The list of things is long, for \\nhere we speak of creating an entirely new discipline, one moreover that \\ncombines two already complex fields: psychology and computer sci- \\nence. Moreover, it requires breaking new ground, for our knowledge \\nof what fosters good interactions among people and between people and \\ndevices is young, without a well-developed foundation. We are going \\nto need a good, solid technical grounding in the principles of human \\nprocessing. In addition, we need to understand the more global issues \\nthat determine the essence of interaction. We need to understand the \\nway that hardware affects the interaction: As Chapter 15 by Buxton \\npoints out, even subtle changes in hardware can make large changes in \\nthe usability of a system. And we need to explore the technology into \\nfar richer and more expressive domains than has so far been done. \\nOn the one hand, we do need to go deeper into the details of the \\ndesign. On the other hand, we need to determine some of the higher, \\noverriding principles. The analysis of the stages of interaction moves \\nus in the former direction, into the details of interaction. In this \\nchapter I have raised a number of the issues relevant to the second \\nissue: the higher, more global concerns of human -machine interaction. \\nThe general ideas and the global framework lead to a set of overriding \\ndesign guidelines, not for guiding specific details of the design, but for \\nstructuring how the design process might proceed. Here are some \\nprescriptions for design: \\nCreate a science of user-centered design. For this, we need prin- \\nciples that can be applied at the time of the design, principles \\nthat get the design to a pretty good state the first time around.

Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting\\u2014Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20.

To investigate whether\\nchain-of-thought prompting in this form can successfully elicit successful reasoning across a range of\\n3\\n\\nlanguage models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are\\nprovided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.\\nFigure 1 shows an example of a model producing a chain of thought to solve a math word problem\\nthat it would have otherwise gotten incorrect. The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the \\ufb01nal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model\\u2019s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in suf\\ufb01ciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting\\u2014Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20. (These particular exemplars did not undergo\\nprompt engineering; robustness is studied in Section 3.4 and Appendix A.2.)

In this new conceptualization, each neural unit consists of a small three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Every time step, each neural unit in a layer is presented with a vector with three elements: an input value, the current state of the neuron, and a bias term. \n\nThe input value, propagated through the random connection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current state of the neuron and a bias term to form a vector. The output of a neuron is then the vector-matrix multiplication. \n\nA significant part of this model is that the neuron has a "state" that, integrated with the input, influences the neuron\'s output. This state is updated at each step, making the neuron into a small dynamical system and equipping it with some memory capabilities. Given different points in the neuron’s history, the same input value can yield different outputs. \n\nThis configuration transforms these neurons into a set of tiny recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique to each RNN.

This neuron would not only process information from one specific type of data (e.g., text), but it could also handle various types of data, such as images, speech, tabular data, protein sequences, or organic molecules. This is due to the homogenization of approaches and models across research communities, where similar Transformer-based sequence modeling approaches are applied to various types of data. This neuron could also be part of a model that learns in-context, adapting to a downstream task simply by receiving a natural language description of the task, a property that emerged with the development of GPT-3.', 'agent_quant': "Based on the text, a neuron for a neural network might be adapted for a quantum computing context. This could involve techniques from novelty search and large language models being incorporated into the neuron's operations, facilitating optimization of its function in the network. Further developments might apply principles from universal artificial intelligence and universal reinforcement learning models, such as AIXI and KSA, to influence the neuron's decision-making mechanisms. For example, the neuron may be trained to make decisions by minimizing a cost function related to the shortest program that compresses past observations and maximizes a set reward function. Additionally, the neuron may have an enhanced ability to understand cause-effect relations, possibly through quantum acceleration of causal inference, and could be designed to handle tasks associated with statistical relational learning applications, such as probabilistic logic networks and quantum variational algorithms. The specific functionality and behavior of the neuron might also depend on the choice of a quantum gate set, adding another layer of potential variability and adaptability.", 'agent_norbert': 'The text does not provide information on how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined.', 'agent_cot': "The text doesn't provide specific information on how a neuron for a neural network could be reimagined. However, based on the discussion of chain-of-thought reasoning and scaling in language models, one could possibly infer that a neuron in a neural network could be reimagined to better support these processes.\n\nFor instance, neurons could potentially be designed to better handle multi-step problems, breaking down complex tasks into intermediate steps, similar to the chain-of-thought reasoning described. This could involve more sophisticated mechanisms for maintaining and manipulating information over multiple steps, possibly involving more complex forms of memory or recurrent connections.\n\nAdditionally, neurons could be reimagined to better support scaling effects. This could involve mechanisms to better integrate information across a larger network, or to handle the increased complexity and diversity of information that comes with larger scales.\n\nHowever, these are speculative ideas and would require further research to investigate."})

From\\nthe perspective of a single neuron, this can be written as:\\n[\\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56]=\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\u210e(n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56\\u00b7[\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,1]\\ud835\\udc47).

The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined based on the text."}], "model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.9}' message='Post details'

COGNITIVE ENGINEERING 41 \\ndisplays of the interface, moving to the perceptual processing of those \\ndisplays, to its interpretation, and finally, to the evaluation -the com - \\nparison of the interpretation of system state with the original goals and \\nintention. But in doing all this, there is one more problem, one just \\nbeginning to be understood, and one not assisted by the usual forms of \\ndisplays: the problem of level. There may be many levels of outcomes \\nthat must be matched with different levels of intentions (see Norman, \\n1981a; Rasmussen in press; Rasmussen & Lind, 1981). And, finally, \\nif the change in system state does not occur immediately following the \\nexecution of the action sequence, the resulting delay can severely \\nimpede the process of evaluation, for the user may no longer remember \\nthe details of the intentions or the action sequence. \\nStages of User Activities \\nA convenient summary of the analysis of tasks is is that the process of \\nperforming and evaluating an action can be approximated by seven \\nstages of user activity\\u2019 (Figure 3.3): \\n0 Establishing the Goal \\nForming the Intention \\n0 Specifying the Action Sequence \\n0 Executing the Action \\n0 Perceiving the System State \\n0 Interpreting the State \\n0 Evaluating the System State with respect to the Goals \\nand Intentions \\n3 The last two times I spoke of an approximate theory of action (Norman, 1984a. 1985) \\nI spoke of four stages. Now I speak of seven. An explanation seems to be in order. \\nThe answer really is simple. The full theory of action is not yet in existence, but whatev - \\ner its form, it involves a continuum of stages on both the action/execution side and the \\nperception/evaluation side. The notion of stages is a simplification of the underlying \\ntheory: I do not believe that there really are clean, separable stages. However, for prac- \\ntical application, approximating the activity into stages seems reasonable and useful. Just \\nwhat division of stages should be made, however, seems less clear. In my original for- \\nmulations, I suggested four stages: intention, action sequence, execution, and evaluation. \\nIn this chapter I separated goals and intentions and expanded the analysis of evaluation \\nby adding perception and interpretation, thus making the stages of evaluation correspond \\nbetter with the stages of execution: Perception is the evaluatory equivalent of execution, \\ninterpretation the equivalent of the action sequence, and evaluation the equivalent of \\nforming the intention. The present formulation seems a richer, more satisfactory \\nanalysis. \\n\\n3. COGNITIVE ENGINEERING 6 1 \\nBecause they affect the ongoing task, they have to be presented \\nat the right time, at the right level of specification. \\nModularity also allows for change: The system can change \\nwithout affecting the interface; the interface can change without \\naffecting the system. Different users may need different inter - \\nfaces, even for the same task and the same system. Evalua - \\ntions of the usability of the interface may lead to changes -the \\nprinciple of iterative, interactive design-and this should be \\npossible without disruption to the rest of the system. This is \\nnot possible if user interaction is scattered throughout the sys- \\ntem: It is possible if the interface is a separate, independent \\nmodule. \\nDo user-centered system design: Start with the needs of the user. \\nFrom the point of view of the user, the interface is the system. \\nConcern for the nature of the interaction and for the user- \\nthese are the things that should force the design. Let the \\nrequirements for the interaction drive the design of the inter - \\nface, let ideas about the interface drive the technology. The \\nfinal design is a collaborative effort among many different dis- \\nciplines, trading off the virtues and deficits of many different \\ndesign approaches.

COGNITIVE ENGINEERING 6 1 \\nBecause they affect the ongoing task, they have to be presented \\nat the right time, at the right level of specification. \\nModularity also allows for change: The system can change \\nwithout affecting the interface; the interface can change without \\naffecting the system. Different users may need different inter - \\nfaces, even for the same task and the same system. Evalua - \\ntions of the usability of the interface may lead to changes -the \\nprinciple of iterative, interactive design-and this should be \\npossible without disruption to the rest of the system. This is \\nnot possible if user interaction is scattered throughout the sys- \\ntem: It is possible if the interface is a separate, independent \\nmodule. \\nDo user-centered system design: Start with the needs of the user. \\nFrom the point of view of the user, the interface is the system. \\nConcern for the nature of the interaction and for the user- \\nthese are the things that should force the design. Let the \\nrequirements for the interaction drive the design of the inter - \\nface, let ideas about the interface drive the technology. The \\nfinal design is a collaborative effort among many different dis- \\nciplines, trading off the virtues and deficits of many different \\ndesign approaches. But user-centered design emphasizes that \\nthe purpose of the system is to serve the user, not to use a \\nspecific technology, not to be an elegant piece of programming. \\nThe needs of the users should dominate the design of the inter - \\nface, and the needs of the interface should dominate the design \\nof the rest of the system. \\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \\nThe chapter has been much aided by the comments of numerous peo- \\nple.

Therefore, the commands would be expected to be used fre- \\nquently. And whenever there is much experience and practice, lack of \\nmeaning and consistency is not so important. Yes, the learning time \\nmight be long, but it only need take place once and then, once the \\ncommands have been learned well, they become automatic, causing no \\nfurther difficulty. Choices of command names are especially critical \\nwhen many different systems are to be used, each with its own cryptic, \\nidiosyncratic choice of names. Problems arise when different systems \\nare involved, oftentimes with similar functions that have different \\nnames and conventions, and with similar names that have different \\nmeanings. When a system is heavily used by beginners or casual users, \\nthen command names take on added significance. \\nPrescriptions for Design Principles \\nWhat is it that we need to do? What should we accomplish? What is \\nthe function of Cognitive Engineering? The list of things is long, for \\nhere we speak of creating an entirely new discipline, one moreover that \\ncombines two already complex fields: psychology and computer sci- \\nence. Moreover, it requires breaking new ground, for our knowledge \\nof what fosters good interactions among people and between people and \\ndevices is young, without a well-developed foundation. We are going \\nto need a good, solid technical grounding in the principles of human \\nprocessing. In addition, we need to understand the more global issues \\nthat determine the essence of interaction. We need to understand the \\nway that hardware affects the interaction: As Chapter 15 by Buxton \\npoints out, even subtle changes in hardware can make large changes in \\nthe usability of a system. And we need to explore the technology into \\nfar richer and more expressive domains than has so far been done. \\nOn the one hand, we do need to go deeper into the details of the \\ndesign. On the other hand, we need to determine some of the higher, \\noverriding principles. The analysis of the stages of interaction moves \\nus in the former direction, into the details of interaction. In this \\nchapter I have raised a number of the issues relevant to the second \\nissue: the higher, more global concerns of human -machine interaction. \\nThe general ideas and the global framework lead to a set of overriding \\ndesign guidelines, not for guiding specific details of the design, but for \\nstructuring how the design process might proceed. Here are some \\nprescriptions for design: \\nCreate a science of user-centered design. For this, we need prin- \\nciples that can be applied at the time of the design, principles \\nthat get the design to a pretty good state the first time around.

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network.

As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer.

To further expand the applicability of quantum algorithms, techniques from novelty search [62]\\nand large language models [63] can be incorporated into these automation engines. Open-ended search in the\\nspace of quantum processes can greatly bene\\ufb01t from a characterization of this landscape, as presented in this\\nwork.\\n5.3 Quantum arti\\ufb01cial general intelligence\\nAmong the more rigorous methods of developing general intelligence is an active formulation of Solomono\\ufb00\\u2019s\\ntheory of inductive intelligence [34], called universal arti\\ufb01cial intelligence [18]. Universal reinforcement learning\\nmodels like AIXI and KSA are capable of rational decision-making or modelling environmental dynamics, based\\non the shortest program that corresponds to compressing the past observations and maximizing a set reward\\nfunction. These have been quantized both by using quantum algorithms, (e.g., in the AIXI-q model [64]) and\\nby applying them to quantum environments (e.g., in the QKSA model [65]).\\nAnother crucial aspect of intelligence [66] is the understanding of cause-e\\ufb00ect relations. Quantum acceler-\\nation of causal inference [67, 68, 69] can bene\\ufb01t from the knowledge of the probability distribution of causal\\noracles, a subset of quantum processes that embed speci\\ufb01c properties of the problem. Besides causal inference,\\nsimilar techniques can be applied to other statistical relational learning applications like probabilistic logic\\nnetworks [70] and quantum variational algorithms.\\nBoth universal distribution and causal inference are intimately connected to the landscape of quantum\\nprograms. This landscape inturn depends on the choice of a speci\\ufb01c gate set, as we saw in this research.\\nThereby, novelty seeking in the space of universal gate sets can meta-optimize quantum program synthesis\\nfor speci\\ufb01c application algorithms. In our current research, we are exploring this direction of second-order\\ncybernetics of automated quantum operational theory, by using the groundwork developed in this article.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis project was initiated under the QIntern 2021 project \\u201cReinforcement Learning Agent for Quantum\\nFoundations\\u201d.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer bene\\ufb01ts such as improved\\nperformance and sample ef\\ufb01ciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The \\u201cother category\\u201d included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of errors in all\\nthree categories. Examples of semantic understanding and one-step missing errors that were \\ufb01xed by\\nscaling PaLM to 540B are given in Figure 10. This result appears consistent with a hypothesis that\\nlanguage models acquire a range of semantic understanding and logical reasoning skills as a function\\nof model scale (though note that model scale is often con\\ufb02ated with other factors, such as amount of\\ntraining compute).\\nSemantic understanding\\n(62B made 20 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 6 of them)One step missing\\n(62B made 18 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 12 of them)Other\\n(62B made 7 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 4 of them)Types of errors made by a 62B language model:Errors \\ufb01xed by scaling from 62B to 540B\\nFigure 9: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. These errors were categorized\\nthat semantic understanding, one step missing, and other. The other category includes hallucinations,\\nrepetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. Scaling PaLM to 540B \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of\\nerrors in all categories.\\nThere are also three notable points regarding why small language models fail. The \\ufb01rst observation\\nis that small language models fail at even relatively easy symbol mapping tasks.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer bene\\ufb01ts such as improved\\nperformance and sample ef\\ufb01ciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The \\u201cother category\\u201d included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of errors in all\\nthree categories. Examples of semantic understanding and one-step missing errors that were \\ufb01xed by\\nscaling PaLM to 540B are given in Figure 10. This result appears consistent with a hypothesis that\\nlanguage models acquire a range of semantic understanding and logical reasoning skills as a function\\nof model scale (though note that model scale is often con\\ufb02ated with other factors, such as amount of\\ntraining compute).\\nSemantic understanding\\n(62B made 20 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 6 of them)One step missing\\n(62B made 18 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 12 of them)Other\\n(62B made 7 errors of this type, 540B \\ufb01xes 4 of them)Types of errors made by a 62B language model:Errors \\ufb01xed by scaling from 62B to 540B\\nFigure 9: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. These errors were categorized\\nthat semantic understanding, one step missing, and other. The other category includes hallucinations,\\nrepetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. Scaling PaLM to 540B \\ufb01xed a substantial portion of\\nerrors in all categories.\\nThere are also three notable points regarding why small language models fail. The \\ufb01rst observation\\nis that small language models fail at even relatively easy symbol mapping tasks. As demonstrated\\nin Section 5, for even symbolic reasoning tasks that only require generalization to new examples\\nusing the same chain of thought logical structure that was given in the few-shot exemplars, small\\nlanguage models still failed. The second observation is that small language models seem to have\\ninherently weaker arithmetic abilities, as shown by Brown et al. (2020), the ability to do simple\\narithmetic operations (without semantic understanding) requires suf\\ufb01cient model scale. Finally, we\\nnoticed qualitatively that small language models often did not generate a \\ufb01nal answer that could be\\nparsed, due to either repetitions or logic that never arrived at a \\ufb01nal answer.\\nIn summary, the success of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale is a complicated\\nphenomena that likely involves a variety of emergent abilities (semantic understanding, symbol\\nmapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc). Future work could more thoroughly\\ninvestigate what properties of pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization objective causally\\nenable such reasoning capabilities.\\n16"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined based on the text."}], "model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.5}' message='Post details'

Instead, it can be represented by a small three-by-two matrix, allowing it to take more than a single value for input and give more than one value as output. \n\nThis neuron model is endowed with a state that is integrated with the input through optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron's output becomes the new state of the neuron, which is then fed back to the neuron with the next input. This essentially turns the neurons into small dynamic systems that are capable of producing different outputs when presented with the same input value at different points in the neuron's history.\n\nIn this model, a layer of such neurons can be viewed as a set of tiny recurrent neural networks. The state of a neuron influences only the next state and output of that particular neuron. These local recurrent states rely on the small matrix of the neural unit. The calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron is also separated to a higher extent in this model. \n\nEach of these reimagined neurons has six parameters that need to be optimized. These aspects give the neuron a form of memory capability and make it more expressive, allowing for more useful representations even when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.", 'agent_snd': "The text doesn't provide information on how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined.", 'agent_foundation': 'The text does not provide specific information on how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined.', 'agent_quant': "Based on the text, a neuron in a neural network could be reimagined in a quantum context. Quantum algorithms could be used to alter how the neuron processes and transmits information. This would involve using techniques from novelty search and large language models to refine the neuron's operations and decision-making processes.\n\nThe neuron could also have functionality related to quantum artificial general intelligence. This might involve universal reinforcement learning models that use quantum algorithms, akin to the AIXI and KSA models mentioned. In this new conception, the neuron would be capable of rational decision-making or modeling environmental dynamics based on the shortest program that corresponds to compressing past observations and maximizing a set reward function.\n\nAdditionally, this neuron could incorporate an understanding of cause-effect relations. Quantum acceleration of causal inference could be used to benefit the neuron's function. \n\nThe conception of the neuron would be closely tied to the landscape of quantum programs, and its functionality could be optimized depending on the choice of a specific quantum gate set. The neuron's operation could further be refined for specific application algorithms by searching in the space of universal gate sets. Hence, the neuron could be seen as part of a second-order cybernetics structure in an automated quantum operational theory framework.", 'agent_norbert': 'Based on the text, a neuron in a neural network could be reimagined as a system that goes through the seven stages of user activity. \n\n1. Establishing the Goal: The neuron would first need to establish its goal, which could be to correctly classify an input or to produce a specific output.\n\n2. Forming the Intention: The neuron would then form an intention, which could be the specific way it plans to achieve its goal, such as by adjusting its weights and biases.\n\n3. Specifying the Action Sequence: The neuron would then specify the sequence of actions it will take to achieve its intention, such as the order in which it will process inputs and adjust its weights.\n\n4. Executing the Action: The neuron would then execute the action sequence, processing inputs and adjusting its weights as specified.\n\n5. Perceiving the System State: After executing the action, the neuron would perceive the current state of the system, such as the current values of its weights and biases and the current output of the network.\n\n6. Interpreting the State: The neuron would then interpret this state, determining whether it is closer to or further from its goal.\n\n7. Evaluating the System State with respect to the Goals and Intentions: Finally, the neuron would evaluate the system state with respect to its goals and intentions, determining whether it has achieved its goal or whether it needs to adjust its intention and action sequence.\n\nThis reimagined neuron would thus be more complex than a traditional neuron in a neural network, as it would involve a more detailed process of goal setting, planning, action, and evaluation.', 'agent_cot': "The text does not provide specific information on how a neuron for a neural network may be reimagined. However, it does discuss the concept of chain-of-thought reasoning in language models, which might suggest some implications for neural network design. In the context of this text, a neuron in a neural network could potentially be reimagined to not just process and pass on information, but also to keep track of intermediate steps or 'thoughts' in the problem-solving process. This could potentially allow for more complex and nuanced reasoning capabilities in the model. However, this is speculative and the text does not provide specific details on how this would be achieved."})

Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on. Whether a pattern is de-\\ntectable depends on the expressiveness of the function. With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term. Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication. From\\nthe perspective of a single neuron, this can be written as:\\n[\\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56]=\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\u210e(n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56\\u00b7[\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,1]\\ud835\\udc47). (1)\\nHere,\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the input value, \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the state of the neuron, and\\nnl,ithe matrix of neural parameters, with \\ud835\\udc59denoting the current\\nlayer in the network, \\ud835\\udc56the placement of the neuron in the layer, and\\n\\ud835\\udc61is the current time step. The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ).

Shortly thereafter,\\nself-supervised learning based on autoregressive language modeling (predict the next word given\\nthe previous words) [Dai and Le 2015] became popular. This produced models that represented\\nwords in context, such as GPT [Radford et al .2018], ELMo [Peters et al .2018], and ULMFiT [Howard\\nand Ruder 2018].4\\nThe next wave of developments in self-supervised learning \\u2014 BERT [Devlin et al .2019] GPT-2\\n[Radford et al .2019], RoBERTa [Liu et al .2019], T5 [Raffel et al .2019], BART [Lewis et al .2020a] \\u2014\\nquickly followed, embracing the Transformer architecture, incorporating more powerful deep\\nbidirectional encoders of sentences, and scaling up to larger models and datasets.\\nWhile one can view this last wave of technical developments purely through the lens of self-\\nsupervised learning, there was a sociological inflection point around the introduction of BERT.\\nBefore 2019, self-supervised learning with language models was essentially a subarea in NLP, which\\nprogressed in parallel to other developments in NLP. After 2019, self-supervised learning with\\nlanguage models became more of a substrate of NLP, as using BERT has become the norm. The\\nacceptance that a single model could be useful for such a wide range of tasks marks the beginning\\nof the era of foundation models.\\nFoundation models have led to an unprecedented level of homogenization : Almost all state-of-\\nthe-art NLP models are now adapted from one of a few foundation models, such as BERT, RoBERTa,\\nBART, T5, etc. While this homogenization produces extremely high leverage (any improvements in\\nthe foundation models can lead to immediate benefits across all of NLP), it is also a liability; all AI\\nsystems might inherit the same problematic biases of a few foundation models [Bolukbasi et al .\\n2016; Caliskan et al .2017; Abid et al .2021, inter alia ]) \\u2014 see \\u00a75.1: fairness , \\u00a75.6: ethics for further\\ndiscussion.\\nWe are also beginning to see a homogenization across research communities. For example, similar\\nTransformer-based sequence modeling approaches are now applied to text [Devlin et al .2019;\\nRadford et al .2019; Raffel et al .2019], images [Dosovitskiy et al .2020; Chen et al .2020d], speech [Liu\\net al.2020d], tabular data [Yin et al .2020], protein sequences [Rives et al .2021], organic molecules\\n[Rothchild et al .2021], and reinforcement learning [Chen et al .2021b; Janner et al .2021]. These\\nexamples point to a possible future where we have a unified set of tools for developing foundation\\nmodels across a wide range of modalities [Tamkin et al. 2021b].\\nBesides the homogenization of approaches, we also see the homogenization of actual models\\nacross research communities in the form of multimodal models \\u2014 e.g., foundation models trained\\non language and vision data [Luo et al .2020; Kim et al .2021a; Cho et al .2021; Ramesh et al .2021;\\nRadford et al .2021].

The\\nacceptance that a single model could be useful for such a wide range of tasks marks the beginning\\nof the era of foundation models.\\nFoundation models have led to an unprecedented level of homogenization : Almost all state-of-\\nthe-art NLP models are now adapted from one of a few foundation models, such as BERT, RoBERTa,\\nBART, T5, etc. While this homogenization produces extremely high leverage (any improvements in\\nthe foundation models can lead to immediate benefits across all of NLP), it is also a liability; all AI\\nsystems might inherit the same problematic biases of a few foundation models [Bolukbasi et al .\\n2016; Caliskan et al .2017; Abid et al .2021, inter alia ]) \\u2014 see \\u00a75.1: fairness , \\u00a75.6: ethics for further\\ndiscussion.\\nWe are also beginning to see a homogenization across research communities. For example, similar\\nTransformer-based sequence modeling approaches are now applied to text [Devlin et al .2019;\\nRadford et al .2019; Raffel et al .2019], images [Dosovitskiy et al .2020; Chen et al .2020d], speech [Liu\\net al.2020d], tabular data [Yin et al .2020], protein sequences [Rives et al .2021], organic molecules\\n[Rothchild et al .2021], and reinforcement learning [Chen et al .2021b; Janner et al .2021]. These\\nexamples point to a possible future where we have a unified set of tools for developing foundation\\nmodels across a wide range of modalities [Tamkin et al. 2021b].\\nBesides the homogenization of approaches, we also see the homogenization of actual models\\nacross research communities in the form of multimodal models \\u2014 e.g., foundation models trained\\non language and vision data [Luo et al .2020; Kim et al .2021a; Cho et al .2021; Ramesh et al .2021;\\nRadford et al .2021]. Data is naturally multimodal in some domains\\u2014e.g., medical images, structured\\ndata, clinical text in healthcare (\\u00a73.1: healthcare ). Thus, multimodal foundation models are a\\nnatural way of fusing all the relevant information about a domain, and adapting to tasks that also\\nspan multiple modes (Figure 2).\\nFoundation models have also led to surprising emergence which results from scale. For example,\\nGPT-3 [Brown et al .2020], with 175 billion parameters compared to GPT-2\\u2019s 1.5 billion, permits\\nin-context learning , in which the language model can be adapted to a downstream task simply by\\nproviding it with a prompt (a natural language description of the task), an emergent property that\\nwas neither specifically trained for nor anticipated to arise.\\n4The prescient work of Collobert and Weston [2008] is related: they trained on a scalable task akin to masked language\\nmodeling jointly with downstream tasks, rather than producing a single foundation model that can be adapted after the fact\\nto downstream tasks."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine a redesign of a neuron"}], "model": "gpt-4", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.5}' message='Post details'

Traditionally, ANNs use simple neuron models where the neuron's state is a copy of its output. However, in this proposed model, each neuron is represented by a small three-by-two matrix that is optimized at every iteration.\n\nAt each time step, the model presents each neuron with a vector containing three elements: the input value, the current state of the neuron, and a bias term. The next state and output of the neuron are determined by the multiplication of this vector with the neuron's matrix of parameters.\n\nThis design endows the neuron with a state, turning it into a small dynamical system. The neuron's output partially becomes its new state, which is then fed back into the neuron with the next input. This integration of the neuron’s state with its input through the optimized neural parameters allows the neuron to yield different outputs when presented with the same input value at different points in its history.\n\nAs such, the layer of these proposed neural units can be seen as a set of tiny recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with each neuron having its unique local inputs. These local recurrent states rely only on the small matrix of neural parameters, meaning that we need to optimize six parameters for each neuron in the network. \n\nThis methodology allows for a more expressive representation of the input, resulting in networks that can perform useful computations even when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.", 'agent_snd': 'The text does not provide information on how to redesign a neuron.', 'agent_foundation': 'The text does not provide information on how to redesign a neuron.', 'agent_quant': "The text doesn't provide information about redesigning a neuron.", 'agent_norbert': 'The text does not provide information on how to redesign a neuron.', 'agent_cot': 'Based on the context provided, it seems like you\'re asking for a hypothetical redesign of a neuron in terms of language models or AI, rather than a biological redesign. In this context, a redesign of a neuron could involve changes to the way it processes and stores information. \n\nFor example, instead of a neuron simply processing and passing on information, it could be redesigned to have a more complex internal structure, allowing it to store temporary "chain-of-thought" information. This could potentially allow the neuron to better handle multi-step problems by maintaining an internal state of intermediate steps.\n\nAdditionally, the neuron could be redesigned to better handle symbolic manipulation, perhaps by having a dedicated section of the neuron for storing and manipulating symbols. This could potentially improve the neuron\'s ability to handle tasks that involve symbolic manipulation, such as math word problems.\n\nFinally, the neuron could be redesigned to provide more interpretable outputs, allowing us to better understand the neuron\'s internal state and reasoning process. This could potentially make it easier to debug and improve the neuron\'s performance.\n\nHowever, this is all speculative and would require significant research and development to implement.'})

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network.

Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ).

Shortly thereafter,\\nself-supervised learning based on autoregressive language modeling (predict the next word given\\nthe previous words) [Dai and Le 2015] became popular. This produced models that represented\\nwords in context, such as GPT [Radford et al .2018], ELMo [Peters et al .2018], and ULMFiT [Howard\\nand Ruder 2018].4\\nThe next wave of developments in self-supervised learning \\u2014 BERT [Devlin et al .2019] GPT-2\\n[Radford et al .2019], RoBERTa [Liu et al .2019], T5 [Raffel et al .2019], BART [Lewis et al .2020a] \\u2014\\nquickly followed, embracing the Transformer architecture, incorporating more powerful deep\\nbidirectional encoders of sentences, and scaling up to larger models and datasets.\\nWhile one can view this last wave of technical developments purely through the lens of self-\\nsupervised learning, there was a sociological inflection point around the introduction of BERT.\\nBefore 2019, self-supervised learning with language models was essentially a subarea in NLP, which\\nprogressed in parallel to other developments in NLP. After 2019, self-supervised learning with\\nlanguage models became more of a substrate of NLP, as using BERT has become the norm. The\\nacceptance that a single model could be useful for such a wide range of tasks marks the beginning\\nof the era of foundation models.\\nFoundation models have led to an unprecedented level of homogenization : Almost all state-of-\\nthe-art NLP models are now adapted from one of a few foundation models, such as BERT, RoBERTa,\\nBART, T5, etc. While this homogenization produces extremely high leverage (any improvements in\\nthe foundation models can lead to immediate benefits across all of NLP), it is also a liability; all AI\\nsystems might inherit the same problematic biases of a few foundation models [Bolukbasi et al .\\n2016; Caliskan et al .2017; Abid et al .2021, inter alia ]) \\u2014 see \\u00a75.1: fairness , \\u00a75.6: ethics for further\\ndiscussion.\\nWe are also beginning to see a homogenization across research communities. For example, similar\\nTransformer-based sequence modeling approaches are now applied to text [Devlin et al .2019;\\nRadford et al .2019; Raffel et al .2019], images [Dosovitskiy et al .2020; Chen et al .2020d], speech [Liu\\net al.2020d], tabular data [Yin et al .2020], protein sequences [Rives et al .2021], organic molecules\\n[Rothchild et al .2021], and reinforcement learning [Chen et al .2021b; Janner et al .2021]. These\\nexamples point to a possible future where we have a unified set of tools for developing foundation\\nmodels across a wide range of modalities [Tamkin et al. 2021b].\\nBesides the homogenization of approaches, we also see the homogenization of actual models\\nacross research communities in the form of multimodal models \\u2014 e.g., foundation models trained\\non language and vision data [Luo et al .2020; Kim et al .2021a; Cho et al .2021; Ramesh et al .2021;\\nRadford et al .2021]. Data is naturally multimodal in some domains\\u2014e.g., medical images, structured\\ndata, clinical text in healthcare (\\u00a73.1: healthcare ). Thus, multimodal foundation models are a\\nnatural way of fusing all the relevant information about a domain, and adapting to tasks that also\\nspan multiple modes (Figure 2).\\nFoundation models have also led to surprising emergence which results from scale.

To further expand the applicability of quantum algorithms, techniques from novelty search [62]\\nand large language models [63] can be incorporated into these automation engines. Open-ended search in the\\nspace of quantum processes can greatly bene\\ufb01t from a characterization of this landscape, as presented in this\\nwork.\\n5.3 Quantum arti\\ufb01cial general intelligence\\nAmong the more rigorous methods of developing general intelligence is an active formulation of Solomono\\ufb00\\u2019s\\ntheory of inductive intelligence [34], called universal arti\\ufb01cial intelligence [18]. Universal reinforcement learning\\nmodels like AIXI and KSA are capable of rational decision-making or modelling environmental dynamics, based\\non the shortest program that corresponds to compressing the past observations and maximizing a set reward\\nfunction. These have been quantized both by using quantum algorithms, (e.g., in the AIXI-q model [64]) and\\nby applying them to quantum environments (e.g., in the QKSA model [65]).\\nAnother crucial aspect of intelligence [66] is the understanding of cause-e\\ufb00ect relations. Quantum acceler-\\nation of causal inference [67, 68, 69] can bene\\ufb01t from the knowledge of the probability distribution of causal\\noracles, a subset of quantum processes that embed speci\\ufb01c properties of the problem. Besides causal inference,\\nsimilar techniques can be applied to other statistical relational learning applications like probabilistic logic\\nnetworks [70] and quantum variational algorithms.\\nBoth universal distribution and causal inference are intimately connected to the landscape of quantum\\nprograms. This landscape inturn depends on the choice of a speci\\ufb01c gate set, as we saw in this research.\\nThereby, novelty seeking in the space of universal gate sets can meta-optimize quantum program synthesis\\nfor speci\\ufb01c application algorithms. In our current research, we are exploring this direction of second-order\\ncybernetics of automated quantum operational theory, by using the groundwork developed in this article.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis project was initiated under the QIntern 2021 project \\u201cReinforcement Learning Agent for Quantum\\nFoundations\\u201d.

Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on. Whether a pattern is de-\\ntectable depends on the expressiveness of the function. With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term. Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication. From\\nthe perspective of a single neuron, this can be written as:\\n[\\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56]=\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\u210e(n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56\\u00b7[\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,1]\\ud835\\udc47). (1)\\nHere,\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the input value, \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the state of the neuron, and\\nnl,ithe matrix of neural parameters, with \\ud835\\udc59denoting the current\\nlayer in the network, \\ud835\\udc56the placement of the neuron in the layer, and\\n\\ud835\\udc61is the current time step. The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ).

Shortly thereafter,\\nself-supervised learning based on autoregressive language modeling (predict the next word given\\nthe previous words) [Dai and Le 2015] became popular. This produced models that represented\\nwords in context, such as GPT [Radford et al .2018], ELMo [Peters et al .2018], and ULMFiT [Howard\\nand Ruder 2018].4\\nThe next wave of developments in self-supervised learning \\u2014 BERT [Devlin et al .2019] GPT-2\\n[Radford et al .2019], RoBERTa [Liu et al .2019], T5 [Raffel et al .2019], BART [Lewis et al .2020a] \\u2014\\nquickly followed, embracing the Transformer architecture, incorporating more powerful deep\\nbidirectional encoders of sentences, and scaling up to larger models and datasets.\\nWhile one can view this last wave of technical developments purely through the lens of self-\\nsupervised learning, there was a sociological inflection point around the introduction of BERT.\\nBefore 2019, self-supervised learning with language models was essentially a subarea in NLP, which\\nprogressed in parallel to other developments in NLP. After 2019, self-supervised learning with\\nlanguage models became more of a substrate of NLP, as using BERT has become the norm. The\\nacceptance that a single model could be useful for such a wide range of tasks marks the beginning\\nof the era of foundation models.\\nFoundation models have led to an unprecedented level of homogenization : Almost all state-of-\\nthe-art NLP models are now adapted from one of a few foundation models, such as BERT, RoBERTa,\\nBART, T5, etc. While this homogenization produces extremely high leverage (any improvements in\\nthe foundation models can lead to immediate benefits across all of NLP), it is also a liability; all AI\\nsystems might inherit the same problematic biases of a few foundation models [Bolukbasi et al .\\n2016; Caliskan et al .2017; Abid et al .2021, inter alia ]) \\u2014 see \\u00a75.1: fairness , \\u00a75.6: ethics for further\\ndiscussion.\\nWe are also beginning to see a homogenization across research communities. For example, similar\\nTransformer-based sequence modeling approaches are now applied to text [Devlin et al .2019;\\nRadford et al .2019; Raffel et al .2019], images [Dosovitskiy et al .2020; Chen et al .2020d], speech [Liu\\net al.2020d], tabular data [Yin et al .2020], protein sequences [Rives et al .2021], organic molecules\\n[Rothchild et al .2021], and reinforcement learning [Chen et al .2021b; Janner et al .2021]. These\\nexamples point to a possible future where we have a unified set of tools for developing foundation\\nmodels across a wide range of modalities [Tamkin et al. 2021b].\\nBesides the homogenization of approaches, we also see the homogenization of actual models\\nacross research communities in the form of multimodal models \\u2014 e.g., foundation models trained\\non language and vision data [Luo et al .2020; Kim et al .2021a; Cho et al .2021; Ramesh et al .2021;\\nRadford et al .2021].

The\\nacceptance that a single model could be useful for such a wide range of tasks marks the beginning\\nof the era of foundation models.\\nFoundation models have led to an unprecedented level of homogenization : Almost all state-of-\\nthe-art NLP models are now adapted from one of a few foundation models, such as BERT, RoBERTa,\\nBART, T5, etc. While this homogenization produces extremely high leverage (any improvements in\\nthe foundation models can lead to immediate benefits across all of NLP), it is also a liability; all AI\\nsystems might inherit the same problematic biases of a few foundation models [Bolukbasi et al .\\n2016; Caliskan et al .2017; Abid et al .2021, inter alia ]) \\u2014 see \\u00a75.1: fairness , \\u00a75.6: ethics for further\\ndiscussion.\\nWe are also beginning to see a homogenization across research communities. For example, similar\\nTransformer-based sequence modeling approaches are now applied to text [Devlin et al .2019;\\nRadford et al .2019; Raffel et al .2019], images [Dosovitskiy et al .2020; Chen et al .2020d], speech [Liu\\net al.2020d], tabular data [Yin et al .2020], protein sequences [Rives et al .2021], organic molecules\\n[Rothchild et al .2021], and reinforcement learning [Chen et al .2021b; Janner et al .2021]. These\\nexamples point to a possible future where we have a unified set of tools for developing foundation\\nmodels across a wide range of modalities [Tamkin et al. 2021b].\\nBesides the homogenization of approaches, we also see the homogenization of actual models\\nacross research communities in the form of multimodal models \\u2014 e.g., foundation models trained\\non language and vision data [Luo et al .2020; Kim et al .2021a; Cho et al .2021; Ramesh et al .2021;\\nRadford et al .2021]. Data is naturally multimodal in some domains\\u2014e.g., medical images, structured\\ndata, clinical text in healthcare (\\u00a73.1: healthcare ). Thus, multimodal foundation models are a\\nnatural way of fusing all the relevant information about a domain, and adapting to tasks that also\\nspan multiple modes (Figure 2).\\nFoundation models have also led to surprising emergence which results from scale. For example,\\nGPT-3 [Brown et al .2020], with 175 billion parameters compared to GPT-2\\u2019s 1.5 billion, permits\\nin-context learning , in which the language model can be adapted to a downstream task simply by\\nproviding it with a prompt (a natural language description of the task), an emergent property that\\nwas neither specifically trained for nor anticipated to arise.\\n4The prescient work of Collobert and Weston [2008] is related: they trained on a scalable task akin to masked language\\nmodeling jointly with downstream tasks, rather than producing a single foundation model that can be adapted after the fact\\nto downstream tasks."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Imagine a redesign of a neuron"}], "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.5}' message='Post details'

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself.

The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network.

With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term. Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication. From\\nthe perspective of a single neuron, this can be written as:\\n[\\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56]=\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\u210e(n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56\\u00b7[\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,1]\\ud835\\udc47).

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself.

The list of things is long, for \\nhere we speak of creating an entirely new discipline, one moreover that \\ncombines two already complex fields: psychology and computer sci- \\nence. Moreover, it requires breaking new ground, for our knowledge \\nof what fosters good interactions among people and between people and \\ndevices is young, without a well-developed foundation. We are going \\nto need a good, solid technical grounding in the principles of human \\nprocessing.

Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on. Whether a pattern is de-\\ntectable depends on the expressiveness of the function. With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term. Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication. From\\nthe perspective of a single neuron, this can be written as:\\n[\\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56]=\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\u210e(n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56\\u00b7[\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,1]\\ud835\\udc47). (1)\\nHere,\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the input value, \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the state of the neuron, and\\nnl,ithe matrix of neural parameters, with \\ud835\\udc59denoting the current\\nlayer in the network, \\ud835\\udc56the placement of the neuron in the layer, and\\n\\ud835\\udc61is the current time step. The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer.

We are going \\nto need a good, solid technical grounding in the principles of human \\nprocessing. In addition, we need to understand the more global issues \\nthat determine the essence of interaction. We need to understand the \\nway that hardware affects the interaction: As Chapter 15 by Buxton \\npoints out, even subtle changes in hardware can make large changes in \\nthe usability of a system.

And whenever there is much experience and practice, lack of \\nmeaning and consistency is not so important. Yes, the learning time \\nmight be long, but it only need take place once and then, once the \\ncommands have been learned well, they become automatic, causing no \\nfurther difficulty. Choices of command names are especially critical \\nwhen many different systems are to be used, each with its own cryptic, \\nidiosyncratic choice of names. Problems arise when different systems \\nare involved, oftentimes with similar functions that have different \\nnames and conventions, and with similar names that have different \\nmeanings. When a system is heavily used by beginners or casual users, \\nthen command names take on added significance. \\nPrescriptions for Design Principles \\nWhat is it that we need to do? What should we accomplish? What is \\nthe function of Cognitive Engineering? The list of things is long, for \\nhere we speak of creating an entirely new discipline, one moreover that \\ncombines two already complex fields: psychology and computer sci- \\nence. Moreover, it requires breaking new ground, for our knowledge \\nof what fosters good interactions among people and between people and \\ndevices is young, without a well-developed foundation. We are going \\nto need a good, solid technical grounding in the principles of human \\nprocessing. In addition, we need to understand the more global issues \\nthat determine the essence of interaction. We need to understand the \\nway that hardware affects the interaction: As Chapter 15 by Buxton \\npoints out, even subtle changes in hardware can make large changes in \\nthe usability of a system. And we need to explore the technology into \\nfar richer and more expressive domains than has so far been done. \\nOn the one hand, we do need to go deeper into the details of the \\ndesign.

COGNITIVE ENGINEERING 41 \\ndisplays of the interface, moving to the perceptual processing of those \\ndisplays, to its interpretation, and finally, to the evaluation -the com - \\nparison of the interpretation of system state with the original goals and \\nintention. But in doing all this, there is one more problem, one just \\nbeginning to be understood, and one not assisted by the usual forms of \\ndisplays: the problem of level. There may be many levels of outcomes \\nthat must be matched with different levels of intentions (see Norman, \\n1981a; Rasmussen in press; Rasmussen & Lind, 1981). And, finally, \\nif the change in system state does not occur immediately following the \\nexecution of the action sequence, the resulting delay can severely \\nimpede the process of evaluation, for the user may no longer remember \\nthe details of the intentions or the action sequence. \\nStages of User Activities \\nA convenient summary of the analysis of tasks is is that the process of \\nperforming and evaluating an action can be approximated by seven \\nstages of user activity\\u2019 (Figure 3.3): \\n0 Establishing the Goal \\nForming the Intention \\n0 Specifying the Action Sequence \\n0 Executing the Action \\n0 Perceiving the System State \\n0 Interpreting the State \\n0 Evaluating the System State with respect to the Goals \\nand Intentions \\n3 The last two times I spoke of an approximate theory of action (Norman, 1984a. 1985) \\nI spoke of four stages. Now I speak of seven. An explanation seems to be in order. \\nThe answer really is simple. The full theory of action is not yet in existence, but whatev - \\ner its form, it involves a continuum of stages on both the action/execution side and the \\nperception/evaluation side. The notion of stages is a simplification of the underlying \\ntheory: I do not believe that there really are clean, separable stages. However, for prac- \\ntical application, approximating the activity into stages seems reasonable and useful. Just \\nwhat division of stages should be made, however, seems less clear. In my original for- \\nmulations, I suggested four stages: intention, action sequence, execution, and evaluation. \\nIn this chapter I separated goals and intentions and expanded the analysis of evaluation \\nby adding perception and interpretation, thus making the stages of evaluation correspond \\nbetter with the stages of execution: Perception is the evaluatory equivalent of execution, \\ninterpretation the equivalent of the action sequence, and evaluation the equivalent of \\nforming the intention. The present formulation seems a richer, more satisfactory \\nanalysis. \\n\\n3. COGNITIVE ENGINEERING 43 \\nmust diagnose the situation and respond appropriately. The diagnosis \\nleads to the formation of goals and intentions: Evaluation includes not \\nonly checking on whether the intended actions were executed properly \\nand intentions satisfied, but whether the original diagnosis was \\nappropriate. Thus, although the stage analysis is relevant, it must be \\nused in ways appropriate to the situation. \\nConsider the example of someone who has written a letter on a \\ncomputer word -processing system. The overall goal is to convey a mes - \\nsage to the intended recipient. Along the way, the person prints a draft \\nof the letter. Suppose the person decides that the draft, shown in Fig- \\nure 3.4A, doesn\'t look right: The person, therefore, establishes the \\nintention \\"Improve the appearance of the letter. \\" Call this first inten - \\ntion intention \\n I. Note that this intention gives little hint of how the task \\nis to be accomplished. As a result, some problem solving is required, \\nperhaps ending with intention2: \\"Change the indented paragraphs to \\nblock paragraphs. \\" To do this requires intention3: \\"Change the \\noccurrences of .pp in the source code for the letter to .sp.\\" This in turn \\nrequires the person to generate an action sequence appropriate for the \\ntext editor, and then, finally, to execute the actions on the computer \\nkeyboard. Now, to evaluate the results of the operation requires still \\nfurther operations, including generation of a foulth intention, inten- \\n[ion4: \\"Format the file\\" (in order to see whether intention 2 and inten - \\ntion \\n 1 were satisfied). The entire sequence of stages is shown in Figure \\n3.4B. The final product, the reformatted letter, is shown in Figure \\n3.4C. Even intentions that appear to be quite simple ( e.g., intention,: \\n\\"Approve the appearance of the lettef) lead to numerous subinten - \\ntions. The intermediary stages may require generating some new subin- \\ntentions. \\nPractical Implications \\nThe existence of the two gulfs points out a critical requirement for the \\ndesign of the interface: to bridge the gap between goals and system. \\nMoreover, as we have seen, there are only two ways to do this: move \\nthe system closer to the user; move the user closer to the system. \\nMoving from the system to the user means providing an interface that \\nmatches the user\'s needs, in a form that can be readily interpreted and \\nmanipulated. This confronts the designer with a large number of \\nissues. Not only do users differ in their knowledge, skills, and needs, \\nbut for even a single user the requirements for one stage of activity can \\nconflict with the requirements for another. Thus, menus can be \\nthought of as information to assist in the stages of intention formation \\nand action specification, but they frequently make execution more "}, {"role": "user", "content": "imagine how to design a neuron based on the text"}], "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.9}' message='Post details'

An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term.

As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network.

Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network. Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on. Whether a pattern is de-\\ntectable depends on the expressiveness of the function.

On the other hand, we need to determine some of the higher, \\noverriding principles. The analysis of the stages of interaction moves \\nus in the former direction, into the details of interaction. In this \\nchapter I have raised a number of the issues relevant to the second \\nissue: the higher, more global concerns of human -machine interaction. \\nThe general ideas and the global framework lead to a set of overriding \\ndesign guidelines, not for guiding specific details of the design, but for \\nstructuring how the design process might proceed. Here are some \\nprescriptions for design: \\nCreate a science of user-centered design. For this, we need prin- \\nciples that can be applied at the time of the design, principles \\nthat get the design to a pretty good state the first time around.

Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on. Whether a pattern is de-\\ntectable depends on the expressiveness of the function. With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term. Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication. From\\nthe perspective of a single neuron, this can be written as:\\n[\\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56]=\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b\\u210e(n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56\\u00b7[\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,\\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\u22121\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56,1]\\ud835\\udc47).

The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters.

COGNITIVE ENGINEERING 41 \\ndisplays of the interface, moving to the perceptual processing of those \\ndisplays, to its interpretation, and finally, to the evaluation -the com - \\nparison of the interpretation of system state with the original goals and \\nintention. But in doing all this, there is one more problem, one just \\nbeginning to be understood, and one not assisted by the usual forms of \\ndisplays: the problem of level. There may be many levels of outcomes \\nthat must be matched with different levels of intentions (see Norman, \\n1981a; Rasmussen in press; Rasmussen & Lind, 1981). And, finally, \\nif the change in system state does not occur immediately following the \\nexecution of the action sequence, the resulting delay can severely \\nimpede the process of evaluation, for the user may no longer remember \\nthe details of the intentions or the action sequence. \\nStages of User Activities \\nA convenient summary of the analysis of tasks is is that the process of \\nperforming and evaluating an action can be approximated by seven \\nstages of user activity\\u2019 (Figure 3.3): \\n0 Establishing the Goal \\nForming the Intention \\n0 Specifying the Action Sequence \\n0 Executing the Action \\n0 Perceiving the System State \\n0 Interpreting the State \\n0 Evaluating the System State with respect to the Goals \\nand Intentions \\n3 The last two times I spoke of an approximate theory of action (Norman, 1984a. 1985) \\nI spoke of four stages. Now I speak of seven. An explanation seems to be in order. \\nThe answer really is simple. The full theory of action is not yet in existence, but whatev - \\ner its form, it involves a continuum of stages on both the action/execution side and the \\nperception/evaluation side. The notion of stages is a simplification of the underlying \\ntheory: I do not believe that there really are clean, separable stages. However, for prac- \\ntical application, approximating the activity into stages seems reasonable and useful. Just \\nwhat division of stages should be made, however, seems less clear. In my original for- \\nmulations, I suggested four stages: intention, action sequence, execution, and evaluation. \\nIn this chapter I separated goals and intentions and expanded the analysis of evaluation \\nby adding perception and interpretation, thus making the stages of evaluation correspond \\nbetter with the stages of execution: Perception is the evaluatory equivalent of execution, \\ninterpretation the equivalent of the action sequence, and evaluation the equivalent of \\nforming the intention. The present formulation seems a richer, more satisfactory \\nanalysis. \\n\\n3. COGNITIVE ENGINEERING 43 \\nmust diagnose the situation and respond appropriately. The diagnosis \\nleads to the formation of goals and intentions: Evaluation includes not \\nonly checking on whether the intended actions were executed properly \\nand intentions satisfied, but whether the original diagnosis was \\nappropriate. Thus, although the stage analysis is relevant, it must be \\nused in ways appropriate to the situation. \\nConsider the example of someone who has written a letter on a \\ncomputer word -processing system. The overall goal is to convey a mes - \\nsage to the intended recipient. Along the way, the person prints a draft \\nof the letter. Suppose the person decides that the draft, shown in Fig- \\nure 3.4A, doesn\'t look right: The person, therefore, establishes the \\nintention \\"Improve the appearance of the letter. \\" Call this first inten - \\ntion intention \\n I. Note that this intention gives little hint of how the task \\nis to be accomplished. As a result, some problem solving is required, \\nperhaps ending with intention2: \\"Change the indented paragraphs to \\nblock paragraphs. \\" To do this requires intention3: \\"Change the \\noccurrences of .pp in the source code for the letter to .sp.\\" This in turn \\nrequires the person to generate an action sequence appropriate for the \\ntext editor, and then, finally, to execute the actions on the computer \\nkeyboard. Now, to evaluate the results of the operation requires still \\nfurther operations, including generation of a foulth intention, inten- \\n[ion4: \\"Format the file\\" (in order to see whether intention 2 and inten - \\ntion \\n 1 were satisfied). The entire sequence of stages is shown in Figure \\n3.4B. The final product, the reformatted letter, is shown in Figure \\n3.4C. Even intentions that appear to be quite simple ( e.g., intention,: \\n\\"Approve the appearance of the lettef) lead to numerous subinten - \\ntions. The intermediary stages may require generating some new subin- \\ntentions. \\nPractical Implications \\nThe existence of the two gulfs points out a critical requirement for the \\ndesign of the interface: to bridge the gap between goals and system. \\nMoreover, as we have seen, there are only two ways to do this: move \\nthe system closer to the user; move the user closer to the system. \\nMoving from the system to the user means providing an interface that \\nmatches the user\'s needs, in a form that can be readily interpreted and \\nmanipulated. This confronts the designer with a large number of \\nissues. Not only do users differ in their knowledge, skills, and needs, \\nbut for even a single user the requirements for one stage of activity can \\nconflict with the requirements for another. Thus, menus can be \\nthought of as information to assist in the stages of intention formation \\nand action specification, but they frequently make execution more "}, {"role": "user", "content": "imagine how to design a neuron based on the text"}], "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.9}' message='Post details'

Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron.

Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters.

As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron.
