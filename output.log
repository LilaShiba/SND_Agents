Before reasoning about the social impact of foundation models, it is important to understand that\\nthey are part of a broader ecosystem that stretches from data creation to deployment. At both ends, we\\nhighlight the role of people as the ultimate source of data into training of a foundation model, but also as the\\ndownstream recipients of any benefits and harms. Thoughtful data curation and adaptation should be part\\nof the responsible development of any AI system. Finally, note that the deployment of adapted foundation\\nmodels is a decision separate from their construction, which could be for research.\\nAdditionally, while many of the iconic foundation models at the time of writing are language\\nmodels, the term language model is simply too narrow for our purpose: as we describe, the scope of\\nfoundation models goes well beyond language. We also considered terms such as general-purpose\\nmodel andmulti-purpose model that capture the important aspect that these models can serve\\nmultiple downstream tasks, but both fail to capture their unfinished character and the need for\\nadaptation. Terms such as task-agnostic model would capture the manner of training, but fail to\\ncapture the significant implication to downstream applications.\\nWe chose the new term foundation models to identify the models and the emerging paradigm that\\nare the subject of this report. In particular, the word \\u201cfoundation\\u201d specifies the role these models\\nplay: a foundation model is itself incomplete but serves as the common basis from which many\\ntask-specific models are built via adaptation. We also chose the term \\u201cfoundation\\" to connote the\\nsignificance of architectural stability, safety, and security: poorly-constructed foundations are a\\nrecipe for disaster and well-executed foundations are a reliable bedrock for future applications. At\\npresent, we emphasize that we do not fully understand the nature or quality of the foundation that\\nfoundation models provide; we cannot characterize whether the foundation is trustworthy or not.\\nThus, this is a critical problem for researchers, foundation model providers, application developers\\nwho rely on foundation models, policymakers, and society at large to address.\\n1.2 Social impact and the foundation models ecosystem\\nFoundation models are scientifically interesting due to their impressive performance and capabilities,\\nbut what makes them critical to study is the fact that they are quickly being integrated into real-\\nworld deployments of AI systems with far-reaching consequences on people. For example, Google\\nsearch, which boasts 4 billion users, now depends on foundation models like BERT [Devlin et al .\\n2019] as one of its signals.5\\n5https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/\\n\\nOn the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models 7\\nFig. 3.

Please take the liberty of imagning based of the texts.', 'result': 'Once upon a time, in a world not too different from our own, there existed a revolutionary technology known as foundational models. These models were not ordinary AI systems; they were powerful, adaptable, and capable of serving as the basis for a wide range of tasks. They were like the foundation of a building, providing stability, safety, and security for the applications built upon them.\n\nIn this world, foundational models had become a crucial part of our daily lives. Companies like Google, with its vast user base, relied on these models to power their search engines. With each passing day, the impact of foundational models on society grew more profound.\n\nHowever, as with any powerful tool, the deployment of foundational models came with both opportunities and risks. The creators of these models recognized that the responsibility lay not only in building them, but also in their careful curation and adaptation. They understood that the ultimate source of data for training foundational models was people, and it was crucial to consider the potential benefits and harms that could befall them.\n\nThoughtful data curation became an integral part of the responsible development of AI systems. The creators realized that the quality and nature of the foundation on which these models stood had to be understood and characterized. After all, poorly-constructed foundations could lead to disastrous consequences, while well-executed foundations could serve as a reliable bedrock for future applications.\n\nAs the next five years unfolded, the integration of foundational models into real-world deployments reached new heights. The impact on people became even more far-reaching. These models were no longer limited to language tasks; their scope expanded to encompass a multitude of applications. They became the backbone of various AI systems, shaping the way we interacted with technology on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, the true nature of these foundational models remained a mystery. Researchers, foundation model providers, application developers, policymakers, and society at large grappled with the question of trustworthiness. It became a critical problem to address, as the consequences of relying on faulty foundations could have severe implications for individuals and communities.\n\nIn this evolving landscape, humans played a crucial role. They were not only the providers of data but also the recipients of the benefits and harms that emerged from the deployment of foundational models. It was their responsibility to ensure that these models were used ethically and responsibly.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it is up to the collective efforts of researchers, providers, developers, policymakers, and society to navigate the opportunities and risks presented by foundational models. With careful consideration, they can harness the power of these models to create a future where the benefits are maximized, and the harms are minimized. The next five years will be crucial in shaping the societal impact of foundational models and determining the path forward for this emerging paradigm.'}
