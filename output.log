The hyperbolic tangent function is used\\nfor non-linearity and to restrict output values to be in [-1, 1]. \\u02c6\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59+1,\\ud835\\udc57\\nis the value that is propagated through weights connecting to the\\nsubsequent layer, and \\u210e\\ud835\\udc61\\n\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56is the updated state of the neuron. As the\\nthree-by-two matrix has six values in total, we need to optimize six\\nparameters for each neuron in the network.\\nRepresenting a neuron by a small matrix means that the neuron\\ncan take more than a single value as input, as well as output more\\nthan one value. Here, we utilize this to endow each neuron with a\\nstate. The state of the neuron is integrated with the input through\\nthe optimized neural parameters. Part of the neuron\\u2019s output be-\\ncomes the new state of the neuron, which is fed back to the neuron\\nwith the next input. This turns our neurons into small dynamical\\nsystems. Presented with the same input value at different points\\nin the neuron\\u2019s history can thus yield different outputs. We find\\nthat stateful neurons provide a convenient and parameter-efficientway of equipping a network with some memory capabilities. One\\ncan see a layer of such neurons as a set of tiny recurrent neural net-\\nworks (RNNs) that are updated in parallel with local inputs, unique\\nto each RNN. As such, a layer of this proposed neural unit differs\\nfrom simple RNN architectures, such as Jordan Networks [ 34] or\\nElman Networks [ 15] in that a state associated with a neuron only\\naffects the next state and output of that particular neuron. These\\nlocal recurrent states only rely on the small matrix of the neural\\nunit, i.e.,\\ud835\\udc5btimes six parameters, where \\ud835\\udc5bis the number of neurons\\nin the layer. A recurrent layer of, e.g, an Elman Network requires an\\n\\ud835\\udc5b-by-\\ud835\\udc5bsized matrix to feed its activations back into itself. Addition-\\nally, the calculation of the neural state and the output of the neuron\\nare separated to a higher degree for the neural units, compared to\\nthe hidden state being a copy of the neural output.\\n4 EXPERIMENTS\\nWe optimize neural units in otherwise standard fully-connected\\nfeedforward neural networks. All networks in our experiments have\\ntwo hidden layers, containing 128and64neurons, respectively. We\\nuse learned neural units for all neurons, including in the input and\\noutput layers. The sizes of the input and output layers vary with\\nthe environments described below. The fixed weight values are\\nsampled fromN(0,0.5). We ran each experiment three times on\\ndifferent seeds, except for the weight-optimized models in the Car\\nRacing environment, which we ran only twice due to its longer\\ntraining times.\\nWhile neurons with recurrent states are common in the field of\\nspiking neural networks that emphasizes biological realism [ 21,22,\\n31,33], it is a departure from the simple neurons found in most\\nANNs. As a control, we also optimize neuro-centric parameters for\\nneurons without a recurrent state ( Simple Neuron ). The setup\\nfor optimizing these is very similar to that of the stateful neurons,\\nbut no part of the output of the vector-matrix multiplication is fed\\nback to the neuron\\u2019s input at the next time step. Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ). To get the number of\\nweights to be similar to neural parameters, the widths and depths\\nof these networks have to be considerably smaller than the random\\nnetworks used in the main experiments. In the second baseline\\nsetting ( Same FFNN ), we train weights of networks that have the\\nsame widths and depths as the networks in the main experiments,\\nand thus many more adjustable parameters. Unless stated other-\\nwise, the activation function for all baseline experiments is the\\nhyperbolic tangent function for all neurons.\\n4.1 Environments\\nWe test the effectiveness of evolving a diverse set of neurons in\\nrandomly initialized networks in three diverse continuous control\\ntasks: the CartPoleSwingUp environment [ 20], the Bipedal Walker\\n\\nLearning to Act through Evolution of Neural Diversity in Random Neural Networks GECCO \\u201923, July 15\\u201319, 2023, Lisbon, Portugal\\n3EVOLVING DIVERSE NEURONS IN RANDOM\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nTypically, optimization of ANNs has been framed as the learning of\\ndistributed representations [ 5] that can become progressively more\\nabstract with the depth of the network.

Instead of being\\nrepresented by three-by-two matrices, these simple neurons are\\nrepresented by two-by-one matrices (vectors in this case) and thus\\nhave fewer parameters to optimize. As such, the parameters of these\\nsimple neurons are simply a scalar of the neural input and a bias.\\nAs baselines, we optimize weights of standard feedforward net-\\nworks. For these, we run two different settings: one has a similar\\nnumber of adjustable parameters as the number of parameters in\\nthe neural unit approach ( Small FFNN ).

Shortly thereafter,\\nself-supervised learning based on autoregressive language modeling (predict the next word given\\nthe previous words) [Dai and Le 2015] became popular. This produced models that represented\\nwords in context, such as GPT [Radford et al .2018], ELMo [Peters et al .2018], and ULMFiT [Howard\\nand Ruder 2018].4\\nThe next wave of developments in self-supervised learning \\u2014 BERT [Devlin et al .2019] GPT-2\\n[Radford et al .2019], RoBERTa [Liu et al .2019], T5 [Raffel et al .2019], BART [Lewis et al .2020a] \\u2014\\nquickly followed, embracing the Transformer architecture, incorporating more powerful deep\\nbidirectional encoders of sentences, and scaling up to larger models and datasets.\\nWhile one can view this last wave of technical developments purely through the lens of self-\\nsupervised learning, there was a sociological inflection point around the introduction of BERT.\\nBefore 2019, self-supervised learning with language models was essentially a subarea in NLP, which\\nprogressed in parallel to other developments in NLP.

Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting\\u2014Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20. (These particular exemplars did not undergo\\nprompt engineering; robustness is studied in Section 3.4 and Appendix A.2.) To investigate whether\\nchain-of-thought prompting in this form can successfully elicit successful reasoning across a range of\\n3\\n\\nlanguage models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are\\nprovided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.\\nFigure 1 shows an example of a model producing a chain of thought to solve a math word problem\\nthat it would have otherwise gotten incorrect. The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the \\ufb01nal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model\\u2019s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in suf\\ufb01ciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models.

Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c \\ufb01netuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following \\ufb01ve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input\\u2013output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting\\u2014Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20. (These particular exemplars did not undergo\\nprompt engineering; robustness is studied in Section 3.4 and Appendix A.2.)

Optimization of weights, is a\\nprocess of fine-tuning the iterative transformation of one represen-\\ntation into another to end up with a new, more useful representation\\nof the input. How the intermediate layers respond to a given in-\\nput depends on the specific configuration of the weight matrix\\nresponsible for transforming the input as well as their activation\\nfunction.\\nRandomly-initialized networks can already perform useful com-\\nputations [ 28,30,61]. When neural units are trained specifically to\\ninterpret signals from a fixed random matrix, as is the case in this\\npaper, the initially arbitrary transformations will become mean-\\ningful to the function, as long as there exist detectable patterns\\nbetween the input the function receives and the output that the\\nfunction passes on and is evaluated on. Whether a pattern is de-\\ntectable depends on the expressiveness of the function. With this\\nin mind, it is reasonable to assume that if neurons in the network\\nare made more expressive, they can result in useful representations\\neven when provided with arbitrary transformations of the input.\\nMotivated by the diversity of neuron types in animal brains\\n[53], we aim to test how well a neural network-based agent can\\nperform reinforcement learning tasks through optimization of its\\nneuro-centric parameters alone without optimizing any of its neural\\nnetwork weights. An illustration of the neural model we optimize\\nin this paper is shown in Fig. 1. Each neural unit consists of a\\nsmall three-by-two matrix of values to be optimized. Each neural\\nunit in a layer is at each time step presented with a vector with\\nthree elements. The input value, propagated through the random\\nconnection from the previous layer, is concatenated with the current\\nstate of the neuron and a bias term. Together, these form a vector.\\nThe output of a neuron is the vector-matrix multiplication.

In our current research, we are exploring this direction of second-order\\ncybernetics of automated quantum operational theory, by using the groundwork developed in this article.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis project was initiated under the QIntern 2021 project \\u201cReinforcement Learning Agent for Quantum\\nFoundations\\u201d.

The GSM8K dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021)\\nconveniently provides a training set with reasoning chains written by crowd compute workers,\\nwhich enables us to investigate whether chain of thought still works with reasoning chains from an\\nindependent source without a background in machine learning. So we randomly sampled three sets\\nof eight exemplars with chains of thought from GSM8K. These chain of thought annotations also\\noutperformed the baseline by a large margin for all four arithmetic datasets (Table 6), indicating\\nthat chain of thought is not dependent on a particular set of annotators.\\n\\u2022Different exemplars. The different GSM8K exemplars experiment above (Table 6) also shows\\nthat chain-of-thought prompting works for different sets of exemplars. Notably, we test every set of\\nexemplars on all four arithmetic datasets (instead of picking exemplars from the training set for\\neach dataset), which suggests that the exemplars do not necessarily have to come from the same\\ndataset distribution as the test examples.\\n\\u2022Different order of exemplars. Prior work has shown that in some cases (e.g., classi\\ufb01cation) even\\nthe order of prompts matter\\u2014varying the permutation of few-shot exemplars can cause the accuracy\\nof GPT-3 on SST-2 to range from near chance (54.3%) to near SOTA (93.4%) (Zhao et al., 2021).\\nWe show the standard deviation of performance from different exemplars in Table 6 and Table 7.\\nStandard deviations with respect to prompt order are relatively minimal in almost all cases. The\\none exception is the coin \\ufb02ip task, for which exemplar orders have high standard deviation, likely\\nfor the reason cited in Zhao et al. (2021)\\u2014for classi\\ufb01cation, many exemplars of the same category\\nin a row biases the model outputs).\\n\\u2022Different number of exemplars. We also found that gains from chain-of-thought prompting\\ngenerally still held when there was a varying number of few-shot exemplars. This is shown for \\ufb01ve\\ndatasets in Figure 11 (we did not have the compute to run this for all datasets). We also found in\\npreliminary experiments that further increasing the number of exemplars in standard prompting\\ndid not lead to signi\\ufb01cant gains (e.g., increasing from 8 to 16 exemplars did not improve the\\nperformance of standard prompting enough to catch up with chain-of-thought prompting).\\n\\u2022Different language models. Another interesting question is whether certain prompts that work\\nbetter for one model work better for other large language models. We \\ufb01nd that with the same\\nprompts, chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all three models (LaMDA,\\nGPT-3, and PaLM) for all datasets except CSQA and StrategyQA for GPT-3 (Table 1, Table 4,\\nTable 5). The fact that gains from chain of thought did not transfer perfectly among models is\\na limitation; further work could investigate why how different pre-training datasets and model\\narchitectures affect the performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting.\\nPrompt engineering still matters, though. Although the results are relatively robust to the prompt\\nfor arithmetic reasoning, we want to be clear that prompt engineering still does matter, and can\\nimprove performance signi\\ufb01cantly in many cases. Though most chain of thought annotations\\noutperform standard prompting, there is large variation in many cases. For instance, for the coin\\n\\ufb02ip task, the performance varied from 99.6% for Annotator A to 71.4% for Annotator C, though\\nboth were above standard prompting = 50.0% (see Table 7). There are even tasks where prompt\\nengineering is a requirement for good performance. In preliminary experiments, we tried using chain\\nof thought to enable language models to reverse the order of a list of 5 items. While two co-authors\\nwere not able to write chain of thought prompts that solved the task despite their best attempts, a third\\nco-author was able to write a chain of thought that perfectly solved the task.\\nHow to generate chain of thought annotations in a robust fashion could be an interesting direction\\nfor future work. For instance, an idea here could be to use a large language model to automatically\\ngenerate chains of thought via prompting (and potentially optimize this over a validation set).\\nA.3 Will chain-of-thought prompting improve performance for my task of interest?\\nWhile chain-of-thought prompting is in principle applicable for any text-to-text task, it is more\\nhelpful for some tasks than others. Based on the experiments in this paper, our intuition is that chain\\nof thought helps the most when three conditions are met: (1) the task is challenging and requires\\n18\\n\\nhow to write the chain of thought annotations other than to simply write the step-by-step reasoning\\nprocess that led to the \\ufb01nal answer. Thus, the annotations were written in each annotator\\u2019s own\\nlinguistic \\u201cchain of thought\\u201d writing style.\\n\\u2022Annotators without machine learning background.

The different GSM8K exemplars experiment above (Table 6) also shows\\nthat chain-of-thought prompting works for different sets of exemplars. Notably, we test every set of\\nexemplars on all four arithmetic datasets (instead of picking exemplars from the training set for\\neach dataset), which suggests that the exemplars do not necessarily have to come from the same\\ndataset distribution as the test examples.\\n\\u2022Different order of exemplars. Prior work has shown that in some cases (e.g., classi\\ufb01cation) even\\nthe order of prompts matter\\u2014varying the permutation of few-shot exemplars can cause the accuracy\\nof GPT-3 on SST-2 to range from near chance (54.3%) to near SOTA (93.4%) (Zhao et al., 2021).\\nWe show the standard deviation of performance from different exemplars in Table 6 and Table 7.\\nStandard deviations with respect to prompt order are relatively minimal in almost all cases. The\\none exception is the coin \\ufb02ip task, for which exemplar orders have high standard deviation, likely\\nfor the reason cited in Zhao et al. (2021)\\u2014for classi\\ufb01cation, many exemplars of the same category\\nin a row biases the model outputs).\\n\\u2022Different number of exemplars. We also found that gains from chain-of-thought prompting\\ngenerally still held when there was a varying number of few-shot exemplars. This is shown for \\ufb01ve\\ndatasets in Figure 11 (we did not have the compute to run this for all datasets). We also found in\\npreliminary experiments that further increasing the number of exemplars in standard prompting\\ndid not lead to signi\\ufb01cant gains (e.g., increasing from 8 to 16 exemplars did not improve the\\nperformance of standard prompting enough to catch up with chain-of-thought prompting).\\n\\u2022Different language models. Another interesting question is whether certain prompts that work\\nbetter for one model work better for other large language models. We \\ufb01nd that with the same\\nprompts, chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all three models (LaMDA,\\nGPT-3, and PaLM) for all datasets except CSQA and StrategyQA for GPT-3 (Table 1, Table 4,\\nTable 5). The fact that gains from chain of thought did not transfer perfectly among models is\\na limitation; further work could investigate why how different pre-training datasets and model\\narchitectures affect the performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting.\\nPrompt engineering still matters, though. Although the results are relatively robust to the prompt\\nfor arithmetic reasoning, we want to be clear that prompt engineering still does matter, and can\\nimprove performance signi\\ufb01cantly in many cases. Though most chain of thought annotations\\noutperform standard prompting, there is large variation in many cases. For instance, for the coin\\n\\ufb02ip task, the performance varied from 99.6% for Annotator A to 71.4% for Annotator C, though\\nboth were above standard prompting = 50.0% (see Table 7). There are even tasks where prompt\\nengineering is a requirement for good performance. In preliminary experiments, we tried using chain\\nof thought to enable language models to reverse the order of a list of 5 items. While two co-authors\\nwere not able to write chain of thought prompts that solved the task despite their best attempts, a third\\nco-author was able to write a chain of thought that perfectly solved the task.\\nHow to generate chain of thought annotations in a robust fashion could be an interesting direction\\nfor future work. For instance, an idea here could be to use a large language model to automatically\\ngenerate chains of thought via prompting (and potentially optimize this over a validation set).\\nA.3 Will chain-of-thought prompting improve performance for my task of interest?\\nWhile chain-of-thought prompting is in principle applicable for any text-to-text task, it is more\\nhelpful for some tasks than others. Based on the experiments in this paper, our intuition is that chain\\nof thought helps the most when three conditions are met: (1) the task is challenging and requires\\n18"}, {"role": "user", "content": "imagine how to design a neuron based on the text"}], "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "max_tokens": null, "stream": false, "n": 1, "temperature": 0.5}' message='Post details'
